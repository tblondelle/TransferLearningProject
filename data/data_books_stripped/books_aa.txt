5 Spiritually and mentally inspiring! A book that allows you to question your morals and will help you discover who you really are!
5 This is one my must have books. It is a masterpiece of spirituality. I'll be the first to admit, its literary quality isn't much. It is rather simplistically written, but the message behind it is so powerful that you have to read it. It will take you to enlightenment.
5 This book provides a reflection that you can apply to your own life.And, a way for you to try and assess whether you are truly doing the right thing and making the most of your short time on this plane.
5 I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60's. The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60's. It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me. After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country (Liberia) at times of illness and the night before I left, this book gave me great comfort. I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future.Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word. I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here. It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through.
5 A timeless classic.  It is a very demanding and assuming title, but Gibran backs it up with some excellent style and content.  If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier, he could have inspired a new religion.From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it.  It is a messege.  A guide book.  A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma.  There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus.  I loved the cover.
5 Reading this made my mind feel like a still pool of water, cool and quiet in a mossy grotto.  It's direct and simple wisdom has a depth of complexity that takes a quiet day to sink in, leaving you at peace.  It is best to set time aside for it, relax, absorb, and let it softly clear your mind.
5 As you read, Gibran's poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you. Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature.
5 Deep, moving dramatic verses of the heart and soul.Truths of  ancient wisdom from a true and romantic poet.Relevant for all eternity.
5 This is a timeless classic.  Over the years I've given it as a gift more times than I can count, and will continue to do so.  Addresses real life issues in a beautiful way and makes us reexamine our own attitude about how we see what happens in our lives.  So easy to read over and over.
5 An amazing work. Realizing extensive use of Biblical imagery and sentence structure, &#34;The Prophet&#34; by Khalil Gibran is a literary classic. Influencing the Free Love movement of the 1960's, Gibran's master work explores themes of love, longing and loss.
5 I LOVE this book... his writing seems to just flow from page to page. I get something different from this book each time I read it..
5 This book has been a classic for many years. It has so much wisdom in it that it can be read numerous times and new things will come out each time. My favorite chapter is the one on children.
5 This book has so much you can take out of it to use in your real life. Amazing, and one of my favorite reads of all time.
5 When I was in college in the 70's this book had a revival and I did not read it then.  Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet.  I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.  But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.  Since I rediscoverd the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerly thanked me.
5 I discovered The Prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then.  Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy.  If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it.  It doesn't care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.  Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it.
5 Can't say enough about Kahlil Gibran's work among this piece. Everybody in the whole world should read this! There is almost too much to take in, really appreciate and put towards our daily lives. In my opinion, it is just one of the most beautiful literature pieces ever written. Would recommend to as a gift for anyone spiritual/poetic/philosophy/educational piece or just something to enjoy here and there. 5 stars for sure!
5 I have the 1972 version, bought in 1974. The 1972 version originally had a dust jacket but my dust jacket is long gone. This particular rendition has had many re-printings, for a reason: it's very popular. The textured paper, old-style typography, and leather cover are better than a plain-old paperback. The size is diminutive, which is perfect for this book.
5 Anything I've read by Gibran is, in my mind, flawless. This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran's work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.
5 Cool book, I really like the quality of the production.  Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag.  I am proud to include it in my collection.  Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.  Excellent for busy people or commuters!
5 This book is everything that is simple, delicate, true, and beautiful.I have read few books so touching and enlightening; &quot;The Prophet&quot; is a true masterpiece that has that feeling of ancient wisdom in it. The wisdom of the text is gentle, yet insistent, it lets you understand things you've always known.My feelings defy description.
5 For those who don't know Gibran, get to know his work. The Prophet is a must read. His outlook on life is truly an inspiring guide on how to approach major life decisions. This is a relationship with a man's work you won't regret having.
5 I would have to say that this is the best book I've ever read.. I could feel every word deep in my heart everytime, of the many times I've read it!  I would never get enough of it! its a treasure..
3 Its a thin book, very readable and has interesting 1-2 page thoughts on various entities like anger, children, religion, speech, silence and its COOL.........reading. Ofcourse if one needs to imbibe the thoughts of the  author, it has to be consumed slowly and perhaps revisited but leaves you  pretty heady and clear about certain things.
2 I read this about a year ago and can't recall a great deal of the book. From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.
5 Loved this book since first I read it, years gone by.  Purchased this copy for a friend who has not ever read Gibran.
5 I first read The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran over 30 years ago and have read it many times since. Gibran's messages are timeless and have always influenced my life and relationships. Over the years I have used it as a gift for persons I cared about. This paperback version has a lovely cover and makes a nice yet inexpensive gift containing valuable lessons for anyone. I purchased three for future giving at the special price offered.
5 It's a thin book which has deep thoughts about topics like love, generosity, death, prayer, etc. It can be read again and again because it is thin while at the sametime it contains so many words of wisdon.
5 Who can ever say anything negative about this great philosopher poet, artist?  Read, enjoy, and apply to your own life.
5 Excellent BookFull of wisdom.  Even though the book wasn't preachey there were a lot of references made to the bible made.
5 I bought this book to supplement a recording I treasure in my collection.. The Prophet is truly inspirational, and poetically illustrates the many challenges and journeys the human spirit traverses from birth to death. The utterings are omni - religious and subtly explain the basic principles  of the human lifespan from an authoritative and spiritual perspective. A must- have for any deep or not-so-deep thinker.
5 This is a fantastic book and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.  Quick read, but also very insightful. It really makes you think.
5 I only wish I could read the original text.  The simplicity and frankness, the blend of respect for the individual and appreciation of spirituality--this is the most astonishing work I have ever read.
5 One of the most profound books I have ever read. You can learn alot about love, life and relationships after reading this book. Very insightful.
3 Maybe some of the folks in his homeland considered him a &#34;prophet,&#34; but I see him as an other person with some ideas but not too many truths. That being said, I like many of his ideas and concepts. If you like spiritual gurus like Eckhardt Tolle you'll probably like Kahlil Gibran.
5 This is one of the first (literary) books I recall reading. My mother kept a collection of Gibran's works that she often read. I was curious to see what attracted her, so I looked into them too ( I was either eight or nine  at the time). I believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed  at the time more relevant than what I was being force-fed by nuns in  catechism class. Rereading Gibran now, I'm struck by the notion that Hesse  must have been aware of these texts before he wrote Siddhartha. They  contain many of the same themes: No one else can guide you on your path.  You must select your own course. Preachers and prophets are a dime a dozen.  True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books. They may appear simplistic to the jaundiced eye, but they may also  provide the inspiration you need to see you through life's travails.
5 Kahlil is so amazing.  To try to express his wisdom with my own words would be more like an insult.  Just read the book and just let it soak in.Carl BozemanAuthor: Amazon bestselling book; &#34;On Being God - Beyond Your Life's PurposeAre You Listening? Addressing the Divine Within &On Human Being - Loving and Living Without Purpose
5 This is one of the best, most inspiring philosophy/poetry books ever written!  I have read it over and over, though never tire of it.  It is a great reminder for what's most important in life and puts everything in perspective.  My favorite 'chapters' are Love, Marriage, Children and The first look. I am a romantic though, so the other chapters may appeal to you more....;-)  Absolutely classic and timeless.  Perfectly stands the test of time. My personal copy is from 1948 and is one of my favorite treasures.
5 This is Gibran's most celebrated work and it is so with goodreason.  It is a profound insight and expose into the human characterand the emotions that work within the heart and soul.  Humble words,seared with the heights and depths of love and of pain, this is a life-changing arrangement of words.  If I had to sum the book up in one word, it would be &quot;SUBLIME.&quot; If you're picking up this title, be sure to order Gibran's 'The Beloved' to go along with it. These are books that deserve a worthy and permanent place on your bookshelf.
5 Intrinsically, this book utilizes a flowing a cleaver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author. While, personally, I found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book, I did find it, simply a pleasure to read. Even with the lack of philosophical epiphany, the style of the book in its fluid manner, the parallel structure of the chapters, and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece, leave the reader, whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not, in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time. As, really, they probably have not, it really did not waste my time anyway; it only took a little over an hour to read (with breaks).
5 When I first started writing poetry at age 12 or 13, I was encouraged to read other poets.  Something I refused to do because I thought it might influence, "My Style"...:)OK, so I was hard headed...  I later was introduced by a Brother In Law to Kahlil Gibran and it was like finding a kindred soul.  I now totally encourage any one that want's to excel in poetry to read the greats.  And you won't find many of the caliber of this man!!!  His words sing from the page both in his poetry and in his short stories!  I love "Martyr's To Man"  (It's been a while but some of the words are still singed in my brain...  And I think it truly speaks of the time we are living in now more than ever...  From memory so not verbatim...Are you a soldier?Who must forsake wife and children?And go fourth into the fields of battle?For the sake of greedWhich your leaders miscall duty?Than you are a martyr to man!There's more but the gist of what I am saying is if you love poetry and you haven't read any Kahlil Gibran you're missing out on one of the greatest poets to ever live!And if you write poetry, I firmly believe Kahlil Gibran should be recquired reading!!!Not that you will feel you have to plod your way through it...You too, will fall in love with his immense gifts!!!Sincerely,And best wishes to allChase vonYour Chance to Hear The Last Panther Speak
5 Beautiful and peaceful read. I carry it in my purse and read it whenever I am waiting for the Doctor, at the airport, etc.
5 This book was great; each chapter was a nugget of wisdom, resulting in a treasure trove by the end. It's no wonder this book is called a classic. Gibran uses a literary style inspired by the Bible, but it is still easy to read. Has a lot of philosophical ideas that I'm sure I will revisit in the future. Seems like one of those books that you learn something new every time you reread it. Definitely recommend, especially for anyone new to philosophy reading because it is short and easy to read.
5 A decade past, I knew very little about the writer/artist/poet/prophet, Kahlil Gibran. I am happy to say, that today, I am well acquainted with his work. The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran, and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words. To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre. I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran's books, that you consider the Prophet as a good start. You will not be disappointed. A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran: The Voice Of The Master; The Beloved; Sand And Foam; The Broken Wings; Between Night And Morn; The Earth Gods; and one of my personal favorites, though not so much a "story," but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends: Kahlil Gibran: A Self-Portrait.
5 The Prophet is Kahlil Gibran's best known work in the western world with over 25 million copies sold. It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the "strange little book" or "the little black book" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was "The Counsels" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as "the poet-prophet par-excellence" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, "extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern." Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature. And in our darkness we will open it to find ourselves again and the heaven and earth within ourselves. Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper. It is the most loving book ever written."I can add little more than that...other than Haskell had a very good point.
5 Love this book. Every time I buy one, I give it away.  This one is for me.  The book arrived on time and in good condition.
3 This book was great in the 60's and it's great still. It makes you feel peaceful inside.It lets you stop and contimplate what you read. Good source of tranquility.
5 Gibran Khalil Gibran was born in 1883 in what is now Northern Lebanon.  In 1909 he went to Paris to study, but he did not like the strict education, and so he traveled, eventually moving to New York.  Gibran became both an artist and a writer, and in 1923 he published "The Prophet", which is generally considered to be his greatest work.  He died of cancer in a New York hospital at the very young age of 48.The Prophet is a story about Almustafa (The Prophet) who after living 12 years in Orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home.  Before he goes, a group of people stop him, and to them he teaches the secrets of life.  Gibran writes in a very poetic manner, and it is wonderful to read.
5 Compared it to works like &#34;Tarantula&#34; by Bob Dylan. Purchased this time as a gift, it was received with praise per its current cover
5 I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased this. I knew only that it was a well-regarded book, and that it was said to be full of wisdom.What I found was a story that was easy to read. There are few words per page, covering the sayings of a wise man as he speaks to those around him. There is a kind of poetry in the words, but not the kind that is difficult to understand. The insights were both familiar and refreshing. It made me reconsider my notions of all aspects of life, although it was less a spiritual revolution than a gentle awakening.I bought the hardcover. It is small and sits easily in one hand. The pages are made from a rich-feeling, textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips. And the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters. Throughout the book are scattered drawings that Kahlil Gibran made. I like them. I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god. Gibran says, "... the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks, than to the least of all the blades of grass." (pp 27-28)  The notion of god that emerges from these pages is of a pervasive connectedness or oneness with nature and the universe.
5 As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled "The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude," I appreciate any book that opens the doors to spiritual understanding. There are few contemporary books that will do this for you in such a poetic way.This is a book containing eternal truths. It was given to me as a high school graduation present many years ago. At the time, I found it beautiful, but I couldn't understand it. That is because I hadn't experienced life.Selections from this book were read at my wedding. The sections on love speak of what it is truly about. Most of us never have an inkling of what true love is since we are caught up in a world of attachment to illusions and delusions. This book will help you to break through them.This is a classic that will stand the mark of time such as the Bible has done. Kahlil Gibran is an old soul who speaks in a language that can be embraced by people of any faith.The book is filled with metaphors and parables. It is almost as if Jesus himself is speaking through the author. Whether or not you will be able to comprehend what the author is speaking about, The Prophet will plant seeds that can bear good fruit.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of "The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude"
5 Eloquent and full of divine wisdom, this little treatise packs more truth into 96 pages than you're going to find anywhere else.  I'll continue to read passages each morning just to remind myself of the beauty and magic of life.
5 I have this entire series in the original, but nothing is quite so good as this one. A wise master is leaving the city. As he departs, the crowd shouts out for him to impart his knowledge. "Teach us about love, education, power, knowledge, etc" they cry. A simple plot for the organization of timeless wisdom.
5 I had this book before and lost it when I moved and I just love it touches my soul and gives me perspective on life.
5 " When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow is that giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight."  G. K. Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:"It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description "divinely inspired."  Brian Bruya"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own."  Claude BragdonPROPHET: LIFE AND TIMES OF KAHLIL GIBRAN
5 Okay I know that Gibhran is supposed to be corny and cliched and assosciated with the hippy movement of the 60's.It does not mean that he also isn't still relevant to anyone seeking answers to what life is about. The set up is simple - as a prophet takes his leave of the people with whom he has stayed for many years, he is asked a series of questions, "tell us of friendship, of love, of work, of death". And to each question the prophet provides an answer.For me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow.But that is only what I took from Gibran and his prophet. Read and take your own message from his words.
5 I received my first copy of this book over 40 years ago.  As a young woman, I found understanding in topics that concerned me; as I aged, my life experiences broadened and this book still gave me understanding and confirmation.I have given this gift to many and they, too, enjoy the book and keep it as a reference.This is a book that keeps on giving what you need as your life experiences or interests change.
5 The prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a very beautiful, inspiring writing which really resonated within me, it felt as truth. I feel that with good patience and deep contemplation, this book can lead you to a profound understanding of your own life and all others around you.I first read about Kahlil Gibran in a book calledThe Lost Teachings of Atlantis. That book answered all my spiritual questions about the meaning of Life, who and what we are and more in a very easily understandable manner and all of it corresponds with the writing of Kahlil Gibran. I HIGHLY recommend reading that book also.
5 _The Prophet_ is a short read (my copy checks in at just under 100 pages), but its berevity belies both the power and beauty of Gibran's words.  At its simplest, it is a discourse on the human condition: love, work, joy and sorrow, crime and punishment, reason and passion, Gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being, laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings.  While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn't really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter "Love", Gibran writes, "... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ... For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.  Even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning. ..."  The contrast, vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life, and the choices I've made.  It would be going too far to say that, as a result of reading "The Prophet" I've had an epiphany or (to take it to a ridiculous conclusion) some sort of a conversion.  Rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me, and how I have demonstrated my "human-ness" in my life.Part poetry, part philosophy, it is simultaneously thought-provoking and emotional.  Undeniably readers will have a visceral reaction (although, apparently given the reviews of some, not all reactions are positive.)  Highly recommended, if only to cause one to examine their own life.  After all, "the unexamined life is not worth living."
5 The Prophet is about a mysterious religious thinker who is about to leave for his native land.  Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man's laws or God's laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother's, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.  Like taking a warm bath, you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers Gibran provides.Before you speak, ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want.
5 Khalil Gibran's book, The Prophet, has the power to transform the darkest feeling of pain in your heart into great release. What a blessing that it exists. Each passage touches on a deep and universal topic (marriage, friendship, etc).  The words, spoken profoundly and clearly from the mouth of the mystic and insightful prophet, who has nothing but words of wisdom to impart to those who gather around him, is a truly life affirming and transformative experience.  Please read this today. It will give you insight on the sacred aspects of all life choices and experiences that exist in the world.
5 Jubran Kahlil Jubran had a teacher make a mistake on his name and wrote down 'Kahlil Gibran' as when he arrived here from Lebanon which was still part of the Ottoman Empire he went by Gibran Kahlil Gibran. His poetry is as timeless as his view towards life and the world at large - everyone was his friend! One passage  &#34;Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it so that the other half may reach you&#34; was used by John Lennon in the white album on a tune called &#34;Julia &#34;.
5 I plan to buy 3 more copies from Amazon, for my departing son & distant friends.Last night, I made a mad dash to get a copy of this book, ten minutes before the book store closed; because I couldn't find my old one.  I had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an SOS to a life-long friend whose comforting presence I really needed, even if just by phone.  Long, sun-lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100+ year old oaks, magnolias, elms, and maple trees, did not make me feel any better.  At home, the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world-wide, or the Oscars; the latter which I could care less about.  It was a very sad and loney moment.Back in Miami I would naturally hit the beach, or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world.  So, in desperation, I jumped in my vehicle, hit the book store, and called on the wisdom of Mr. Gibran.  I sipped a glass of red, kicked back on my couch, and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present.  I don't know why, but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end.  In little over an hour I'd read slowly through each page, and felt 100% better.On physical inspection, this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice.  But don't be so easily deceived, because this book packs more useful information than any 50-pound college textbook, without the endless verbage of a 1,000 page Russian novel.It is small, the paper of good weight and quality (the ones I always purchase, at least), the print is big and the illustrations done by Mr. Gibran are simple yet humana and divinical.  The words are brief and powerful, comforting and idiot-proof.  Perfect healing food for the love-starved yet attention-deficit crazy world we now live in.  I was first given this book by a friend, as a departing gift for a 7,000 land/sea voyage, back in 1983.I hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me.  I sent this book to him as my comforting presence.
5 Echoing the reviews of others - it is obvious that Gibran both was inspired by and inspired many of the great writers of all ages.  From Buddha to Coehlo, and countless others in between, there is a depth of truth and a veil of simplicity that, once lifted, opens the mind, heart and soul to universal wisdom.It is not hard to understand why Gibran was as popular in his day, and in the 1960's, as he was.  Covering the landscape from religion to love, Gibran bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the Prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey.  The metaphors are numerous and the scale of depth is exceptional.The book itself is nearly 100 pages, but the content is not readable at any level rapidly.  This book is one that bears constant revival and renewal.  It's a well that provides the reader with sweet water of wisdom which merits frequent draws to slake the thirst.A must have and a must read.
5 I stumbled onto this book, and it opened my mind and began my process of becoming aware.Then I went across country to collect my deceased Grandmother's belongings. One item was this book. I opened the the cover and saw that Grandma had lent it out to her friends and they all had signed it. One person who had signed it was my Mom, who had died years before before my Grandma. I'm going to buy it for my little arrow now. 4th generation of passing it on.
5 I read this book many years ago, It is a book that should be on ones book shelf to read often. It takes several readings to get to the heart of his deep writings of philosophy. Glad I replaced the one I lost.
5 These days, Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet" often gets dismissed as "hippie" literature. Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. "It Must be a cult," he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics ("On Love", "On Work", "On Joy and Sorrow", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem "On Children" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, "Breaths.""Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you."At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent's roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a "middle ground" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in "unwinding" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What's more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran's contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of "The Prophet" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book's table of contexts either using Amazon's "Search Inside" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That's a good a place as any to start with. Chances are, you will find something that speaks to you on some level.
5 I have loved this book for forty years, both the written version and the audio (Richard Harris narrating I believe) with orchestral accompaniment. This new format only increases its accessibility.
5 When Gibran was first introduced to me, I had definite doubts that his work would be the ordinary, grab a dictionary sort of read. But when you first open to those sections that apply to you, and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears, well, shock is the only word for it. Yes, the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in 'The Prophet' may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned, but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed, unique. I've purchased countless copies to the ones that I know will love and understand his words. And if for nothing else, Kahlil's work can be labeled as truly, a literary work of art.
5 Kahlil Gibran - touchs the heart, the soul and the mind.Beautiful words that comfort and guide.If only more people would read his work, if you can call it work,Wonderful writing but the publisher (as many seem to do these days) get very artisticand print too faintly -  the letters are pale grey and very difficult to read.It isn't the writing it's the publisher at fault.The printers should realize that the entire purpose of the printed word isto let people READ it.
5 The Prophet, for me, is a very vivid yet dense book. It speaks some sort of wisdom, and I delight in that wisdom when I can understand it.The illustrations are done by the author himself, which is nice.
2 The language is poetic, but it is not poetry.  It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  "Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'"Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all "cosmic" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: "He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked."Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this "It Takes a Village" gem: "And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all."  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  "The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured."  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of "The Prophet" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'"Forget that Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole "one source, many wells" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  "Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!"  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of "love thy neighbor" philosophy, it still defines "good" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a "do unto others" prescription, but "You are good when you are one with yourself."If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, "Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit."  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path ("a truth") to God:"Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek."Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  "You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!"  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism ("You are good when you are one with yourself," if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of "The Prophet."  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that "The Prophet" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that "The Prophet" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word "hedon."  "Hedonist" sounds like a philosophical school, as does "epicurean."  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.  I probably made up that word too.)
5 This book is almost as if Kahlil Gibran took the pains and joys of millions of people and somehow managed to encapsulate all these wonders in this one book.  In his own unique manner, Gibran has explored every facet  of human existence.  Although the book has a sacred charm to it, there is a  universal appeal that should allow anyone of any religious persuassion  enjoy this gem of a book. I wouldn't be surprised if a few hundred years  from now some theologians unearth this book and conclude that it was a  bible of our times.
5 Have purchased many in the past like in the 1970'safter I received one as a gift.  I recommend to all ages.
4 Kahlil Gibran is a wonderful poet. He is a philosopher who meshes the bible with his prose. Very spiritual to read.
5 Residing in my mind are the words of a true poet.  I was given the book THE PROPHET by my best friend when I was young.  It has followed me through my life and has filled me with the emotions and practical thought I needed to guide me through the smooth and rough waters of my life.  I gave this copy of Kahil Gibran's book to a young lady with the hope she will enjoy it the rest of her life.  Thank you Amazon for having this wonderful work of art available to all.
5 Certainly the words are of Kahlil Gibran, but the eternally PRESENT divine wisdom told through his words is from the source of all sources. Only those who are ready to receive the divine wisdom are destined to read and know the meaning behind the meanings of his words. This is one of the five most valued books that I keep on refering again and again for solace and peace of MYSELF.While writing - or rather while being an instrument to write this book - Kahlil Gibran must have reached the original source of all the knowledge and wisdom available to humankind.Gibran's book is music, poetry, wisdom and truth - all at the same time!I salute Kahlil Gibran for giving us the &quot;THE PROPHET&quot;.
2 I evidently misread the writeup, I thought it was a hardback.  It was a cheap paperback.  I got it as a present so I couldn't send it back but I'm very dissapointed for the cost!
5 If there were more than five stars, this book would surely deserve it.  This book is the paradigm of wisdom, humility, and grace.  This is my favorite book on my shelf, and I would recommend this book to anyone.  Truly, if Gibran was a religion, The Prophet would be my Bible.  Never has  inspiration hit me with such velocity as reading this book.
5 It has helped to replace the many dysfunctional premises my sociopathic parents modeled! This is a book with a popularity which continues to grow at phenomenal rates! I had to buy this version since I'd lost my original classic one. There certainly NEED to be more Half Price Book Stores here in CA!!! I got spoiled by having 3-4 in Dallas alone!
5 I was given this book by a writer friend who called it &quot;the most beautiful book I've ever read.&quot; So, since she and I have similar literary tastes, I was inclined to read it. This little book, written in a rich, colorful, deep, and wise poetic style, is full of some of the most moving and impressive spiritual phrases and messages I've ever read. It was written in 1923 but its poetry and wisdom are timeless.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;
1 As Amin Rihani described his own friend Gibran, Gibran's style of writing is just &#34;mawkish sentimentalism&#34;. Yes, sentimentalism, and that is all Gibran is all about. For most Americans' taste, this guy is just pasty! And who can stomach that!
5 The Prophet is a poetic, in some aspects, means of viewing life.  Kahlil Gibran was able to draw on various aspects of life and compile a take that is, in some senses, new and appreciable.
5 I usually don't like getting books that I did not ask for. When someone buys a book for me, there is a certain obligation to actually read it, but doing so takes away time from the books I really want to read. There are so many books on my reading list and so little time to read them all that getting an unasked-for book feels like someone actually stealing from me: stealing valuable reading time.In the case of *The Prophet,* however, I did not resent the choice of my benefactor, even though I had not asked for it.First of all, it was a very quick read, consisting of twenty-nine poetic speeches by the fictional "prophet." He delivers them as his last word on various topics, since he is about to head back home after having lived in a foreign city for twelve years, and the people ask him to speak on all the important issues that touch on human life: family, food, work, emotions, economics, social problems, art, morality, spirituality, death, etc.On most of these issues, the prophet takes what might be called an Eastern stance. He stresses the importance of "letting go" rather than "taking charge," whether it's in relationship to your children, conflict situations, or the end of your life.I did not find it necessary, however, to fully agree with this Eastern outlook to appreciate the book, both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts. For whatever your own worldview, a degree of "letting go" is an art we can all learn.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofJob's Wager: An Alternative to Pascal's Wager and the Atheist's Wager (With Color Illustrations)
5 A must in everyone's library for graceful poetry, inpirational reading and lessons to live by and to even to let go.  A new printing would be a welcome as the "used" ones in good condition are quite expensive.
5 The Prophet dispenses ultimate wisdom to his loved ones as he bids fare well.Khalil Gibran defines all that I never had words to define, or more appropriately, did not have the good sense to define.  I discovered this book a while back and took a long time to read it since I refused to rush through it.  I read it a lesson at a time, understanding it to the best of my ability.I found a way of life in these words.  I could read it everyday and each time these words would dispense a new lesson... like a never ending treasure.
5 Truly a classic of world literature, Gibran has snatched a chunk of wisdom from the ether--from and for the ages--and fashioned it into a masterwork.
5 This work still holds up decades later. Every reflective, thoughtful person should have The Prophet in the home library. It can be read one chapter at a time. The chapter on love is as good as anything I've ever read.
4 This is an excellent short book of inspirational fiction by one of the best poets of all-time. I especially love the artistic cover of this well made paperback edition.
5 The Prophet was given to me by a good friend when my Dad passed away twenty years ago. I loved it the first time I read it and I have given several copies away to friends/family who have lost someone they loved or had a problem I thought the book could help them with. I have 2 copies at home now and I often refer to it. A book you won't want to part with.
5 This book is poetic myth,a work of beauty,whose every word drips a truth,and a thought of knowledge.Reading it is like swimming in realitybut a reality I have not known,till now.Kahlil Kahlil Gibran knew something we did not,he shared a bit of the wonder of simplicity.Though this is merely the preaching of a Prophet,Gibran is able to turn it into story,and I feel from the gut for all the characters.The Prophet is unsurpassed in form,in content best when speaking of beauty,in ways I had never known,and weakest when speaking of prayer.Certainly Gibran relies on the story of Jesus,and throughout there are allusions to his wordsand actions.But this is a new prophet,who speaks the words of old,though it be in new wineskin.
4 I would buy from this seller again.Kahlil Gibran was a genius. "The Prophet" uses a lot of old English, but is still an easy/quick read. I can see why this book has been translated into dozens of different languages. - Definitely words to live by. A poet.
5 I was given this book as a high school graduation gift and I have found it to be the book I look to in hard times as well as good times, for advise, inspiration, hope and words of wisdom.  I highly recommend it.
5 This book was recommended to me by a friend. What he told me of it is that, just as The Art of War, this is the book from which you take out whatever you want. What you find in it depends as much on the book as it does on you. It speaks of love, life and people in the most touching way ever. I have it in my handbag at all times. When I first read it, I cried. There is literally something mystical about it. I like to think I took a lot out of it. One of those books you should read again and again and again..
4 Easy read. Interesting book. I bought this book on a chance of luck & really enjoyed it. I recommend it to everyone.
5 This is a book you can read and re-read many many times.Great and timeless thoughts about relationships, love andfriendship.  I will share this with my family. :)Jeffrey C. McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown Eyed Boy&quot;
5 Slow reading but full of Significant messages.Took long to read in order to fully capture and understandhis message.
5 The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a book that's been around for a while. There are many passages in the book and many basic topics on marriage, children, friendship, work and pleasure, which will touch you in one form or another.
5 This is a classic of world literature.  Everyone with a poet's heart, a lover's heart, a philosopher's heart, a dancer's heart, a parent's heart, a leader's heart, or simply who enjoys beauty found in life's joys and sorrows, this book is simply the best.
5 I was in my twenties when I first read The Prophet.  I am now 65.  The Prophet has grown in the depth of its content as I have been able to understand more deeply.  This book, I believe, has the meaning of the holy writings of all the great religions.  As you read, decide if all these writings do hold the same great truths.
5 A book to be treasured. A tremendous poet dealing mostly with Christianity and spiritual love. His insights on topics of life are to be cherished. I have read his treasured poems many times and brightened the lives of others by sharing. This book was highly inspiring during my emotional spiritual journey to discover my biological roots. I listed The Prophet as a key reference source in my book Adoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child.Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child
5 I read it in an hour. Kahlil Gibran is definitely the people's philosopher. The book itself seems to be written on impulse, and the author knows what the modern world is looking for. The context is powerful and sensitive, and more than anything it's the truth.
5 Reading a classic such as &quot;The Prophet&quot; is much more fruitful when it is revisited often, the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if Gibran is writing only to him or her.Sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from Gibran, listening to him speak.  The accompanying art work also by Gibran gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer.Listen, embrace and breathe in these words.Open your mind and heart to The Prophet.
3 Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for a heavily poetic book on one man's life philosophies, but this book lost me after the chapter on children. Some sections are insightful and very well written. On death, children, and love were my favorites. I'm not sure how novel these ideas were back in 1928 (?) when the book was first published, but they are nothing new today. Still, the flowery language is pretty, it's not overly long, and also it's probably one of those books that make you look cool when your reading it at a coffee shop.... so it's not all bad.This book was given to me by my dad who grew up in the 60's and 70's. It occurs to me that The Prophet seems to speak best to those from this generation (peace, love, and all that crap... you know). Maybe it's just not relevant to me? Maybe I need to approach it at a different time? Maybe I need to smoke something herbal?
5 Gibran gets right down to the bedrock of what it is all about.  He was obviously a very enlightened man, and The Prophet is so completely, psychologically and spiritually healthy. Anyone who would not consider this work a standard for healthy living, is simply simple-minded.  This book should be offered to all high school students as a guide in gaining perspective on what is really important in life.  I first read The Prophet about 10 years ago, and I typically read it about once a year, just to remind myself.  However, I gave my copy to my son who showed signs of being &quot;at risk&quot; at age 17.  I believe the book had a significant, positive impact on him, and he is now 20 and living a very responsible and balanced life.  After my son had read this book, I found him on the telephone one evening reading passages to a friend.  It made him think, and any time you can get a teenager to think, it's a very good thing.
4 The book came in great condition, as well as, on time. Feel sad, though, because it was lost in a move.
5 A short and magnificent book that will forever withstand the test of time because it speaks to, and from, the heart.
5 Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), the Lebanese-American poet and mystic never wrote anything finer than this 1923 volume, his masterwork. Had he written nothing before or beyond THE PROPHET, he would still be remembered into perpetuity.Each brief chapter of THE PROPHET addresses an aspect of the human condition, including Love, Marriage, Work, Pleasure, Buying and Selling, Children, Eating and Drinking, to name but a few. Gibran espouses no particular religious, ethical or moral system, and yet includes them all in this slim tome, written it seems, with a quill of light, not ink.A Higher Power (by whatever name you may call it) spoke through Gibran in the writing, a perfect letter to the ages, and an ultimate expression of Humanity.
5 My father has this huge book collection and I remember I was around 12 when I found this book amidst a sea of books and I thought it was pretty small, so I read it in one sit...It changed my life.It talks about life, love, friendship, death, etc. All of these answers that you spend your entire life searching for...are in this book. It tells you all of these things that you already know about life, but somehow we keep in the back of our heads so we don't have to do the right thing, as if ignoring them will make us more human by default. There is no place that I go that this book doesn't follow me.I remember in college having this teacher that I despised so much and the class was talking about their favorite book and when it came my turn I said "The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran" and she got all excited too and said "That's my favorite book too, it's like my Bible"...I remember thinking "How can I have something that is so important to me in common with someone that I despise?"...I guess that's the thing about life...I will never forget that or her...
5 This is Kahlil Gibran at his best.  The prophet is uplifting, thought-provoking, lyrical, simplistic, and completely unforgettable.  Gibran's unique prose poetry rythym flows like wine while reading it.  This  book is a classic.
5 My favorite book.  I used the passaged in my wedding ceremony.  I read it over and over and never tire of it
5 received on time and thank you for rel good on time service.HIS CHAPTER ON PAIN IS THE BEST.
5 This book takes different themes such as work, love, etc. and poses them as questions that a community asks a wise man, who seems to be spirit talking. He is a man who is not so much of a religious base but more filled with a love of nature finding peace and depth through sensory and embracement of all dark and light. He is a person who has freedom in all areas of his life and learns from all things and all moments because of his openess and aliveness. He wants all people to gain awareness from their path thru eternity. This can be read in a variety of ways coming from each person's belief system. I read this when I was in a state of loss, loss of so much. This book can bring understanding and a shift in consciousness at least for a spell of time. It can expand who you are while you process and integrate his writings. I most definately recommend this book, for all people on their journey in whatever space they are in on their path of life.
5 "A brilliant man's philosophy on love, marriage, joy, sorrow, time, friendship and just life. Originally published in 1923 - translated into more than 20 languages. Also has drawings by Gibran...A poetic ,inspiring little book that you can read over and over again..."
4 I wanted the book the Prophet as an anniversary gift to my spouse. We read this book while dating. He had copies before but lost track by giving them away. I went to Amazon and put in the title and there it was...nothing like whatit would have cost retail. So for me it was just what I was looking for, at the price I could pay, in the condition I could use for the perfect gift for my husband. Thank You!
5 A prophet has waited twelve years in a coastal town for the ship that will bear him back to his homeland, which he misses.Why he is there, why he is waiting, how he knows what he knows, and who he is is a mystery.  As he departs the townspeople gather to wish him well. A local seeress who knows him best asks him to share his wisdom so that it will endure for generations to come.So, he reveals his wisdom on love, birth, marriage, children, pain, talking, pleasure, death any so much more.It is a profound work, and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself:You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.But let there be spaces in your togetherness,And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.Love one another but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.And stand together, yet not too near together:For the pillars of the temple stand apart,And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.Its not a little similar to theTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics)where a border guard recognises Lao Tzu, and asks him to share his wisdom as he goes into exile.  Written 2,500 years ago, and one of the most translated books in the world.  The Tao contains many principles you can use in your everyday life, and if you're not thinking in  ego based ways, your wisdom based thinking opens up..If you like one book, you will love the other, so I recommend both.  For the Tao, I recommend the Stephen Mitchell version.  Hope this was useful.
4 This book was the first and only I've read by Kahlil Gibran. Every chapter offers insight and philosophy on almost every subject that a person can think about. From death to love to marriage to friendship Kahlil Gibran offers a very sensitive view of all aspects of life. I've reread it many times.
5 Everyone carries an omnificent quality within themselves.  Some individuals have not grasped this concept.  Some individuals do not realize that a simple change can create a huge transformation.  Would you ask an important figure for advice before she or he left town?  Their advice would be elements about life that you already knew, but seemingly forgot. There are simple fundamentals to follow that can make you a better person within your own eyes.Gibran uses The Prophet Almustafa to enlighten readers with simple tactics they can use to live a more pure and genuine life.  How many of us love, go to work, have clothes, feel pain, and own friendships?  You do not have to be religious to appreciate this book.  Gibran's classic takes common stress factors that everyone can relate to, and shares guidance on how to simplify it in your life:  "When you work with love, you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another" ( p. 26).  Read this book and share it.  Think about the most valuable portion to you in this book. Share that portion with another person.
5 Since I first read The Prophet when I was a teenager I have had a copy by my side.  It is a gift of such value in comprehending the depth and meaning of this wonderful Life in its beauty of every relationship that engages us.  Be it work, parenting, eating, death or love, Gibran paints word images of such divine and exquisite loveliness that, once read, will change the reader's perspective forever.  It is a book to refer to again and again as life unfolds and offers new opportunities for spiritual growth and awareness.It is a book I have given as a gift to many young people as they grapple with the frustrations and distortions of an often incomprehensible outer world.  It is a book of beautiful truths and a map to our own seeking souls.  I particularly love this edition which includes Gibran's original drawings.
5 I have been reading The Prophet every year for over a decade. Or intending to. It's an incredible read. If I'm having issues in my life, I read the section that relates to my problem and it helps clarify things somewhat. It is a divinely inspired piece of work, and can be read in one setting. There is pretty much nothing that he doesn't cover in the book that can't be related to your own life. I bought the ebook version so I could have easier access. It's a book for everyone.
5 Needed to read this and could not find my old copy, so bought a new copy and it still helps me when I need to remember what is inside this lovely collection of wisdom!
4 I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Ever since then, I have sought out his books.  The Prophet is my favorite.  Several of the  &quot;poems&quot; or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life.  The  book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others.  There is  barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on-love, marriage,  death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life.  This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough  time, or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives.  The writing is lucid, insightful, and will be relevant for as long as time  goes on.The drawings add to an already great work.  At my favorite Lebanese  restaurant, I not only found good food-I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran.
1 I appreciate getting the book at the great price.  I'm really not complaining but the book was quite yellow and the jacket was torn in various places.  It looked like it was on the shelf for quite a while........Maureen
5 I first read this book as a teenager. It has remained on my bookshelf, being read many, many times. I have given it as a gift to several people, over the years. It is one of my favourite books.The Prophet is a classic, and is considered to be Kahlil Gibran's masterpiece. Gibran himself considered it his "greatest achievement". Originally published in 1923, it has been translated into 28 languages, and is still a popular piece of literature today.The book is a beautiful blend of poetry and philosophy. Each chapter takes on a particular topic, or aspect of life. "The Prophet" speaks on love, work, law, freedom, pain, time, and many other important issues we all deal with as we journey through life. Each beautifully written chapter is also illustrated by Gibran.The importance and beauty of this book is immeasurable and timeless. This book should be on every bookshelf of those who truly enjoy the beauty of poetry and classic literature, to be enjoyed and appreciated by every generation. The life lessons offered by Kahlil Gibran are timeless in essence and belief.
2 I picked up this book after being inspired by some quotes from Kahlil Gibran. This is a brief text written in a flowery language that masks some simple points. I did not find this book inspiring or insightful, but it was a short read.
5 This was my favorite book when i was 19! So I purchased it for my 19 yr old granddaughter. Hope she loves it as much as I do!
5 Great read! A book for the ages! Each little piece of prose/poem has something simple and profound to tell us all.
5 Got this book for my son who wasn't familiar with Kahlil Gabran. Everyone should read him at least once don't you think? The book was more attractive than pictured and small - fits in his pocket. He likes it.
5 This is an amazingly beautiful book.  The writings are spiritual and absolutely beautiful.  They cover almost every aspect of life and provide inspiring, poetic and though-provoking words in answer to questions raised about them.  When my mother passed away, I read this book over and over again.  Many use the chapter on marriage as part of their wedding vows.  My daughter asked me to read that chapter to her and her husband as part of their wedding ceremony.  I cannot think of a better way to spend $10.00.  You will more than get your money's worth even if you only read one chapter in the book.
5 This is classic reading, which I did read when it was &#34;young&#34;.I was glad to find it available for Kindle.
4 For one who would prefer Truth coming from a source other than the King James Version, "The Prophet" is written with the voice of wisdom and the beauty of poetry. If there is a Black and White 'Truth,' one could easily seek it here in almost all the verses.
5 Gibran wrote the ultimate way of seeing life and living in it. the importance of each relationship. The book was written to be relatable to every reader, all the subjects are mondain. The availability of this book is a great advantage that I don't think people are aware of. It's an hour long to read, but a lifetime to understand, if you read it you'll remember it in every new life matter or relationship.Buy it and keep it on the shelve for reference, it's an answer to everything. and read it carefully.
4 Gibran was a great author and in this book he truly shines. I recommend this book to anyone, even if he/she is not into reading. The book is short but full of wisdom. I only gave it 4 stars because the idea of the book (and even the title) are taken from "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" which I gave 5 stars. So I didnt think it would be fair to give this one an equal grading. I actually recommend both books, but The Prophet is much easier to read, while Thus Spoke Zarathustra is deeper and more intelligent.
4 My friend Renee gave this to me a few years back and asked me to read The Prophet.  I started reading it shortly afterward and honestly had to stop for a little while because I tried consuming too much (sorry, my normal is history, historical fiction, and either sci-fi or fantasy); after all, this is poetry and philosophy and should be consumed like a fine wine or excellent scotch, slowly savoring the flavor.  Having let things slip a little longer than intended I started reading it again, this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing  the impact on me.  This time things flowed somewhat better for me.  The individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone.  While I don't always agree with Mr. Gibran philosophy for a subject, some are particularly moving; for me in particular his passage on Joy and Sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two, describing to me why both can be so strong.Rating this one is extremely complex.  Some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have; others flow over you, whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later.  Because I wasn't touched by all, I call this a very strong 4 star book and can easily see why lovers of poetry or philosophy could call this a 5 star book.  What I can say though is thank you Renee for exposing me to The Prophet.
5 This book was given to me as a gift before I journeyed overseas on a  spiritual quest to &quot;find myself.&quot; I never got a chance to read it  until one month after I was there and I had lost my job, my relationship  was very unsteady, and being so far form home, I felt completely isolated.  After skipping around the book and reading sections that immediately  pertained to me at that point, I cried, not out of sadness, but out of  enlightenment...Gibran wrote his experiences,and his thoughts on life, but  they are such detailed poetic accounts, it applies to everyone at some  time, his writings have layers, and therefore this book can be read many  times over, and each time a new understanding will come. &quot;Your pain is  the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding...&quot;
5 My brother was looking for this book and I ordered it for him.  I was pleased with the price and the fact I could have it shipped directly to him.  Thanks Amazon!
3 I originally read this early in college and didn't think it was anything special then.  I saw it recently in a used bookstore for two bucks, so I bought it.It took about an hour to read.There were about a dozen short passages I underlined.  Most of them weren't really revelations, but rather really good analogies I liked or uniquely descriptive ways of presenting commonly known truths.
5 Being an Atheist, it may seem strange to some people that this book holds any meaning for me, but I think that, despite the religious references, people from all walks of life will relate to the poetic prose of The Prophet.Kahlil Gibran has been greatly celebrated in several countries for the book's simple yet biting phrases. Any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought-altering quote.Gibran uses a prose style throughout. Short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words.Each section has something poweful to say, but some of my favorites were those on Work, Giving, Children, Crime and Punishment, Freinds, Time, and of course Love.As oppposed to most books containing the word "Prophet" anywhere in the title, Gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible. The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back. Decadence is not suggested, but the basic purpose of Gibran's legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets.It is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading "just one more section." What makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the author's statements, but also the beauty of his words, the flow of his language.I hate to be like everyone else (in more instances than just this), but it does change you. It states what any prophecy should, and allows the religious aspects of the beliefs to take the backseat to the love of life and aspirations.Buy, read, and live by The Prophet's words.
5 I bought this book for my son who had his stolen from him and was in despair.  He likes the beautiful poetic resonance and in looking through the book, I agree.  This is a book for sensitive souls, beautifully written and illustrated by the author.
5 A classic which has only improved with time.  The thoughts and ideas in this book would make the world a better place!
5 I can't think of a title fitting enough. What can you say about a book that you believe to be one-of-a-kind? I have yet to find a book that I can compare it to. I suppose I could at least explain why I find this book to be so unique.First of all this book covers most all of life's complex issues in the simplest fashion, and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation. Secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people, but I cannot be so shallow to think that I am reading a said story... I am not reading the said story--what is actually happening is that I am the listener and Kahlil Gibran is the prophet himself.  I strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself, you are probably reading some other book.I think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading, in fact with that said, I can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling. You may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered. You may feel regret  like I did,  I regret not having this book earlier in life to help me. I believe that a great many of you will feel amazed. It is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life's puzzles.There is a quote from the "Urantia Book" that is appropriate in closing this review. The quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings I received from this incredible story, and that quote is.. "The argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained." ...and I give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth. I am a firm believer that if Kahlil Gibran is not a modern day prophet, no one is, and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity. I cannot think of anyone who would not love this book.
5 I've always been wary of stories claiming ownership of principles of truth and wisdom, and attempting to package them in tidy, marketable portions for mass consumption.  However, I found this novella unique and unpretentious in it's delivery of many truths that at first glance may appear intuitive, but in reality escape me in the daily practice of my life.  It was a well-written, thought-provoking tale that helped me focus on the most important things of my daily life.
5 My intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading, rather than the timeless content, the quality of which is well known.I very much enjoyed Paul Sparer's reading. I found his rich bass voice and eloquent style ideal for Gibran and very pleasing to listen to. Unlike another reviewer, I was not at all distracted by the music; in fact, I barely noticed it. Taste in such things is a personal issue, and for what it's worth, this reading very much suits my tastes.
5 I have loved this book since I first acquired it decades ago...a classic in every since of the word. I have always kept a book copy, had to have an e-copy too.
5 Gibran's words strike as deep and sudden as lightning, and lay bare to you, with unbelievable simplicity, the truths of human life. And they do so beautifully. To read this book is to enrich yourself, enlighten yourself, and to enjoy some of the most beautiful words ever written. Gibran's accompanying drawings are as mystical and moving as his words, and accentuate the utterances of the Prophet.The sheer wisdom and beauty of this little book is undeniable. All hail the Prophet.
5 Here is a book that will get your spiritual side working again.  This book subscribes to no particular religion(s), but gives much to reflect upon.  This is a short book.  It will only take you around an hour or so to read it.  But if you want to take a break from the hectic day-to-day lives we lead and think about the deeper meanings of life, this book is for you.  It's the story of a prophet that comes to a town and gives the townspeople his wisdom.  They ask him questions about life, and he gives them deep spiritual answers.  Simple concept, great read.
3 An unusual departure of an imaginary prophet ... Saying goodbye, his people gather around him asking about human nature and life!!The dialogue takes the form of questions and answers...which makes it a little monotonous...but the poetic language and the symbolic style of explanation takes your mind away and makes you wonder impatiently what the next question will be!!An inspiring revelation of truths ..."Love one another, but make not a bond of love...Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music"
1 This man was a son of a pastor, but worshipped a profit, not God - Do your homework on him. The Bible is the truth. Don't be misled by what this book tells you.This quote is from Wikipedia - Thompson reported Gibran later saying that all the way through writing "Jesus, the Son of Man", he thought of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;. Years later, after the death of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, at a viewing of a movie of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, Gibran rose to talk and proclaimed in tears an exalted station of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; and left the event weeping. A noted scholar on Gibran is Suheil Bushrui from Gibran's native Lebanon, also a Bah&aacute;'&iacute;, published more than one volume about him and serves as the Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the University of Maryland and winner of the Juliet Hollister Awards from the Temple of Understanding.Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;' (Arabic: &#1593;&#1576;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1607;&#1575;&#1569;&#8206;&#8206;; 23 May 1844 - 28 November 1921), born `Abb&aacute;s Effend&iacute;, was the eldest son of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h,[1] the founder of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith.
5 I recently read an article in The New Yorker Magazine about Kahlil Gibran, writer born in the middle east to Christian parents. Kahlil Gibran managed to immigrate to NYC with his mother and siblings.  Gibran's personal life and his early death, his exotic looks and ability to both write and paint is what attracted me to read his masterpiece "The Prophet".  It is a mystic story, written in verse, less than 100 ages long with a dozen fantastic paintings that remind of magical realism in painting.  The book is a manifest on how to live, love, work, dress, embrace joy and sorrow, accept righteousness and mankind far from perfection.  It is a book of duality that in the most beautiful language a young philosopher teaches the ways to live life.  No matter what world, culture, continent or country one comes from,this verse is universal.  If anything, this piece of work has compelled me to seek out other of Gibran's work.  I need to get into a mind of this wonderful thinker who himself led a very complicated and solitary life.  It has been a long time since I read anything as beautiful and touching as this piece of literature.
1 You've got to be kidding, all you 5 star reviewers!  This overly sentimental trash is sickening! It just rambles on and on with nonsense. It is said that Gibran is a great poet. Really? It has no poetic value whatsoever. Save your $2, my friend, and if you're looking for enlightenment try &#34;Siddhartha&#34;.
5 I am almost 51 years old. When i was 18 and deeply conflicted, weighted down with the confusions that can only be so impossibly painful at that young age, my mother gave me a hardback copy of "The Prophet". I've carried it with through all these years as a treasured companion. It helped me make sense of the non-sense my life was back there in 1974, and has comforted me more then a couple times in the years since then, as well.Today i'm here at Amazon to buy the same book for my 19-year-old daughter. She's a bright, warm, funny, sweet girl who is undergoing no small amount of angst as her comfy girlhood world slips away.  Her friends have begun to scatter to the winds--some to jobs and some to college--and her own adult responsibilities loom ever taller.Why, she has asked me, why do i feel so sad? I have no reason to be so sad--but i am. Why?And my mind has flashed to:"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.And how else can it be?"So i want this book for my wonderful daughter.  I think she's ready for it and, better, i think it will help the turmoil in her soul as it did for me when i was her age, and for my mother before me.
5 Inspirational and true teachings about various aspects of life are what you will find when you read this beautiful book. The book is short, 96 pages, and includes artwork by the author. The short chapters begin with various people (a ploughman, a judge, a woman, a rich man, an old priest, a mason, a hermit, etc.)asking the mystic to speak about different subjects of life, such as:  On Beauty, On Good and Evil, On Marriage, On Joy and sorrow, on friendship, and many more)I have to say that if I had come across this book much earlier in my life, I know I would not have understood or appreciated the beauty of it. I mentioned a quote from this book to a friend once who told me that her mother in law gave her the book years ago, and she had never read it. I told her what a treasure it was and after (finally) reading it, she loved it too.There is so much wisdom here to learn from. This is an incredible book!
5 I am alive like you, and I am standing beside you.Close your eyes and look around, you will see me in front of you.~Gibran's words on his EpitaphThe Prophet captures the teachings of Kahlil Gibran in a comforting story that succinctly touches on everyday topics like love, giving, joy, sorrow, freedom, pain, teaching, friendship and beauty. Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer "dwell in the solitude of your heart" so they "live in your lips."As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his "ship arrives" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home."Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?"The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: "Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory."Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as "her young prophet."  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart."But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night." ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review
5 When i ordered this book i knew it was worth it. The Prophet teaches us about life with its pains, sorrows, joy and love and much more. This book deserves more than five stars, i highly recommend it.
5 The prevailing popularity of Gibran's PROPHET lies in only one secret: he writes his poems with readers in his mind. The compassionate poet I come to know through his lines, Gibran did not write to impress, shock or confuse but to communicate truth with highest poetic beauty. THE PROPHET addresses 27 essential subjects of life that concerns everyone - love, freedom, children, work, self-knowledge, friendship, time, beauty, death to name a few. I have this book for many years but this is a kind of poetry that ripens with time and each time you take a sip, it still surprises you with refreshing revelations. Also recommended are his less known books, A TEAR AND A SMILE, SAND AND FOAM and THE GARDEN OF THE PROPHET.
5 Seldom has there been a book that I have read time and time again as much as this one.  I have given this book numerous times to people as a small gift.  I have used this book in my son's christening when he was a baby and on numerous holidays.  These words are every bit as relevant when they were written.  For all time, this book still ranks in my top 5.
5 "The Prophet" is a supreme literary achievement that has impacted millions of people around the globe. The Prophet has been translated into many languages and has sold millions of copies. Gibran's chef-d'oeuvre will provide the reader with an ecstatic, refined, and transcending literary experience !!!
4 The Prophet is an elegant and beautifully crafted piece of art that eloquently states Universal Truths concerning all pertinent aspects of ourlive. These include love, death, justice, art, etc. It's divine poetr that could have only been inspired by the creator of this magnificent world.Highly recommended.
5 This is a very usefull book that can be used as a secondary source for your primary religious texts. Not only does it give you excellent prophetic sayings, but when reading anyone could have a diffrent interpretation. Here is some things you could look to find:-Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.-Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."-Say not, "I have found the path of the soul," but rather, " I have met the soul walking upon my path."  For the soul walks upon all paths.-You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts.-For what is evil, but good tortured by it's own hunger and thurst.-And beauty is not a need, but an ecstasy.-Who can seperate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupation.-To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconsistency.-No man can reveal to you aught but that wich is already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.-If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshhold of your own mind.-And even as each of you stands alone in god's knowledge, so must each of you be alone in his knowledge of God and his understanding of the earth.
5 I recently reread this after many years and found the words to resonate with wisdom and spiritual centeredness. The book can be enjoyed and read with profit by people from all faiths and traditions. Each will find some treasure that speaks to their heart. There is nothing in THE PROPHET that would contradict or conflict with any of the sacred texts of the world's major religions. It somehow encompasses the teachings of all of them in a secular and beautiful work of literature.
1 This book was a philosophical touchstone for insecure Boomers of the mid-1970s. Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:"...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited..."In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how "relevant" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song "Consider Me Gone" for consideration:"To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell"
5 One of the best books written in English, ever.  Simple, yet extremely penetrating like &#34;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&#34;, deeply thought-provoking like &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land&#34;, semantically precise yet as moving as the Psalms of David, Gibran's masterpiece is timeless.
5 This is a wonderful expression of some of the fundamental truths of human nature and existence. This little book is always on my desk and every now and I revisit it again and ruminate over the wisdom that Al Mustafa gives to the people of the city of Orphalese.As Al Mustafa prepares to leave Orphalese after 12 years, the seeress Almitra implores,"Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth.And we shall give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish.In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and laughter of our sleep.Now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death."...and thus begins the beautiful explanation of love, marriage, children, houses, clothes, teaching, talking, religion and many more. Actually you can read this entire book online, so you don't necessarily need to purchase one to enjoy it. Some of my favorite ones include, On Houses, On Teaching, On Talking and On religion.and he parts by saying ,"Less hasty am I than the Wind, yet I must go.We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us"
5 Quote from The Prophet &#34;You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and bold steps. Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping. Even those who limp go not backwards&#34;.This book has wise views from the author about all areas of our lives like love, marriage, crime, knowledge, pain...etc, it's written in semi poetic way with simple writing.
5 This is an excellent book.  it arrived in good shape.  i have loaned it out to other people.  they are astounded that it is a used book
5 This book never ages, it is sincerely ageless...
5 I love the Prophet and tend to buy copies to give to people who may need it's message.  I don't ever loan mine out because it never comes back!  This book speaks on all matters human!  I've owned it since I was 14 and go back to it constantly.  I especially love the sections on children, love and marriage.  It's a wonder insightful read and I highly recommend it.  It's also rather spiritual which is lovely.  It's not like the bible, but easy to read and take in.  It can give you peace when you need it.  Please consider adding it to your library.
5 This book still holds all the philosophical magic 70 years after Gibran wrote it.  He managed to distill some basic truths about life and they are as applicable now as they were then.
3 As he (the "prophet") awaits the ship that will return him to his home country after fourteen years of being absent, he begins providing answers in colorful parables to questions raised by the occupants of the city he has temporarily made his home.  We follow this spiritual man as the loving townspeople seek him out for wisdom.  There is ultimately great sadness when he departs.I would describe these writings as poetic, philosophic prose for daily spiritual living.  There are many sound words, with a relaxed style, and a somewhat universalistic belief.  It is okay.Lord's blessingsScott
5 Have had this particular book for many years. I have given it to family and friends. Especially young  woman. For me, it put life in proper perspective and especially helpful when both my children moved to Europe. Think there is something for everyone.
5 One of the classics that everyone should read. It is also one of the most profound books that is this short.
5 Pure mastery in words revealing the essence of life. Very simply, this book speaks to everyone. It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe. It brings tears to me each time I read it, because if your mind is open, you will achieve a feeling of higher existence upon completion of your reading. I hope you will take that understanding and infuse it within all you do.I also recommend listening to Richard Harris' reading of this book, though it may be out of print these days.
4 I can never quite make up my mind on this book. I read it years ago and was also somewhat puzzled by it. Rereading it I feel vague inspiring feeling, and the other a kind of vague repulsion. I see many many readers are inspired by the work. I myself feel it to be a kind of sentimental popular mixture of Whitman and Zarathustra, but without the great lyric sweeping of the former or the fierce intellectual irony of the latter.I believe the most famous section of the work of twenty- six poetic essays is the one on 'Love"Here is some of this:"Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;For love is sufficient unto love.When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," but rather, I am in the heart of God."And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;To return home at eventide with gratitude;And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.I am reminded when I read this of Bellow's description of the healer in 'Seize the Day' Dr. Temkin. On the one hand he says and thinks that it is phony  , and on the other he hears certain things and says ' True , True.'.I must admit my reaction remains mixed. I do not feel it is really poetic truth of the highest value, but I do not feel it is without value either.
5 Should we, could we all walk through life in such an enlightened state? What a wonderful peaceful world it would be. How can we deny that Kahlil Gibran was directed by the Gods to deliver a message: "be as one, live in the light, love is the only answer!" and so I paraphrase, but in truth, it is a way of life that is essential to the well-being of mankind.
5 If I have ever read a book that is timeless, other than the Word of God, it would have to be this one.  Although I may not have agreed with every word written, so many of the words of wisdom within these pages brought peace and comfort to me.I read this book many, many years ago.  I quoted from it at times and thought of it often. The words seemed to wrap themselves around your heart and spring out in times of need. There are not many books that can stake that claim, and I have read many.A classic in my opinion and a book that will never be outdated.Recommended.
5 I first stumbled across Gibran in a quote a firend shared with me while I was going through a divorce. The quotes on Pain, Joy and Sorrow, and Love became touchstones. This is a very touching perceptive work.
5 I highlighted or wanted to highlight almost every word.  So much beautiful metaphor, and profound wisdom here.  I wish everyone read this and took it to heart.
5 This is a very beautiful book. It contains a lovely section on marriage, emphazing the importance of seperate identities between lovers.
5 This may be a short book, but it is full of insight. It is perfect to dip into at odd moment for that renewed spiritual focus or uplift, or just as good to read in one sitting. It is a classic with good reason and cuts to the core with it's deceptively simple style. There is much depth to this book to be explored and comes highly recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
5 Have you ever read a line, first you feel the language is beautiful and next a thought, even a reality hits you? And even after you have finished, the message keeps playing on and on in your mind? Well, this book is one of them (if you have luckily found other books by other author).It is the exploration of self, soul, community, nature, and universe. No matter what religion you hold, from where you came or who/what you are. This is a book for every human being to know and keep in perspective what they are doing everyday.
3 This book is tagged as THE PROPHET by KAHLIL GIBRAN. Alas I know I'm easily annoyed but I didn't even open the sample of this book once I saw that the title and author were in all caps. I'm sure the text is fine but I didn't bother to look. I bought a different edition instead.
5 Like watching an Olympic athlete or listening to an accomplished singer reading Khalil Gibran is in many ways indescribeable.In that way, it's good that many of the other reviewers have tried to describe this book by giving anectodes of how it personally touched them.  But ultimately those anectodes are like the stories of people who've gone to some great vacation spot.Sure, they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or appreciating its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there.Because of the way this book is written, some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word.I wish we could award more than five stars.  I wish it could be an infinity...for every heart touched by this wonderful, wonderful book.
5 I turn to The Prophet for perspective whenever life gets distorted and seems to be on its own track. This book offers poetic and visionary commentary on some of the most vital points of living, and does so in a creative, thought-provoking way. I first learned of Kahlil Gibran and The Prophet during a sermon at a Unitarian Universalist church, and I ran to get the book. It's occupied an important place on my bookshelf ever since. It helps me realize that life is a process, and letting go is a big part of moving forward. It also reminds me to be mindful of how I think about and interact with the world. It keeps things in perspective. The Prophet is an inspirational read.
4 I have no memory of buying this book but I had it when I was a kid and loved it. Maybe I should buy it again . I have no idea where it is now
5 Great little book full of (seemingly) common sense.  Should be read by any judgemental person or religomanic.  Should be cheaper!
5 I just love Gibran. I have most of his writings. It took him 9 years to finish this little book, and it is so spiritual, not religious. It is a book of love. I highly recommend this work to everyone.
5 At least 6 out of 5 stars! "The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain", is my favourite quote from this classic book of magical mystical poetry and philosophy. There is insight and wisdom on every page. 25 years after someone first leant me a copy, it seems to have more relevance to life's fundamental challenges than ever.Kahlil Gibran tells the story of Almastafa's departure from the city of Orphalese. As he leaves, the prophet (Almastafa) shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience. "Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding", "Work is love made visible", "And think not that you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course".However "The Prophet" is much more than a few inspiring self-help quotes. More a case of some of the deepest Eastern wisdom, universally applicable to the human condition. Long may it continue to inspire countless numbers of people around the world.
5 It is a true masterpiece in which almost every, if not every word counts.  I have read it over and over again, since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before I left for Berkeley to attend law school.  I have given copies to many friends, and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully.There is enormous wisdom in each chapter, especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live - which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings.  Gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of Life, and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century.This book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what Life is really all about.  Indeed, it can be picked up at any age, and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written.I urge anyone, who is thinking about buying it, to do so.  Just peruse a copy at a local bookstore or library, and you are apt to become enthralled.  It may take several readings to soak up its essence; and even after many years, I still find nuances and learn more each time I reread it.
5 "Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'"--Kahlil GibranAs you read, Gibran's poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you.  Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature.This is a book to read alone or with a partner, to give and receive, to go back to again and again.Note: the excerpts available in Amazon's "Search This Book" facility unfortunately do not do "The Prophet" justice, since only the book's introduction is included, whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later.  Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, "Speak to us of Children."And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.
4 Great book; I shared with my co-workers and haven't gotten it back yet so everyone at work is enjoying the book as much as I did....
5 A very short book, only 133 pages published in 1926. To be honest I have no idea why I downloaded this. I have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago, which I found interesting, so it must have been that!  Gibran is described in Wikipedia as, 'the third best selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.'The book is written in bible-esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you.  On the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today.There are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of 'The Prophet' by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them, returning to his 'home'.MarriageChildrenGivingEating and DrinkingWorkJoy and SorrowCrime and PunishmentFreedomReason and PassionPainTeachingFriendshipGood and EvilPrayerPleasureReligionDeathSo many of the words written by Gibran over 80 years ago, must surely, if you are tempted to purchase this book, resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change, for the better, on how you interact with others and with yourself!I'm not saying that I have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book, I personally still have no idea whether I am an atheist, agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along, if that is indeed possible.  I did write somewhere in regard to the Bible, and I suppose in the same tone the Koran would be included, that I look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it (them) without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it (them), the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind, but that aint gonna happen.  But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran's words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.Enjoy.....Editing for Kindle: 4 out 5Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5Plot:Overall Rating: 5 out of 5Chapters:Page length: 133
5 Beautiful, wholly accessible, brought tears to my eyes.  As graceful as Jesus' parables must have been when freshly spoken, without the distortion of time and culture and multiple translations.  The Prophet had been on my list of "oh yeah, I've heard about it and probably should read it one day" books.  A friend's recommendation bumped it from there into my Kindle.  This is the book that motivated me to learn how to underline and save notes, the Kindle equivilent of dog-earing my favorite parts.  (Somehow less satisfying than a dog-ear, but really easy to retrieve later.)Other books that have made it from the list to my shopping cart sit largely unread because they are just too much work.  I probably won't read Don Quixote, for example, until I'm sitting on the Spanish Med and polishing my classic Spanish.  Easy AND good for you.  How perfect is that?
5 Gibran may be a poet, rather than a true prophet - but the simple truths in this book seem applicable to all religions. The short passages on love, children, pain, beauty, death and other timeless topics are full of insight and inspiration, but completely lacking in the politics and self-righteousness that pervade so many religions. This book is goodness, plain and simple, and it changed my life more than any other book I can recall reading.
5 I plan to buy this book,and a few others,that I had a long time ago. To write a better review I would need to refresh myself on Eastern or Middle Eastern mysticism;Persian more specifically,Sufism and also the background of Kahlil Gibran.What I can say is that these small stories or parables or fables are Zen-like; thought-provoking and instructive. I loved this book when I read it and I wrote one of my (still) best poems while I was in the state of mind this book put me in. (I'm positive it was just after I turned 16 because I have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a Friday night football game in the distance from the high school...and not wanting to go to another football game because I had to free my friend from the outside port-a-potty after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out....and naturally my claustrophobic friend started screaming and freaking out. She did the same thing I would do.Anyone of any age can enjoy this book,I just wish I had a copy around so I could refresh my memory and do a more detailed review. Of course I'm sure I would have read it more than the one time I read it, if I did have the same copy I had when I was a teenager. I always read books I really like more than one time.This book and The Little Prince by Saint Exupery;Siddhartha,Demian and Steppenwolf (all by Herman Hesse) are books I read at the same time period and that I also don't have anymore,either because I gave my copy to someone;or,had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away, or,they just went the way of all things,as things go...in time (and my 16th birthday was quite awhile ago...sigh.... 16 has also "gone the way of all things"....but not completely!)Anyone who likes The Prophet (or any of the other titles I mentioned) can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read,or who has one of these books on their bookshelves;or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature. (It's  "A Beatles Thing". Not so much connected to The Beatles, but people who like the same type of music always like their friends more,when their friends like the same type of music that they like. Beatles, Zeppelin,Pink Floyd,Rob Zombie, Black Sabbath or Godsmack...Or Johann Sebastian Bach...writing or music,it's still art. And we just feel more comfortable with people who have interests or feelings or an intellect similar to our own. ....Aesthetic magnetism is a vibration more in tune with the spirit;and everyone is in love with their soul-mate(s)...to have common ground; or be in sympathy with one another on a deeper level than the common plane of the inescapable movements of the mundane.)....Anyone reading The Prophet,and finding themselves on common ground with the author,will find gratification,and will know exactly what I mean in what I wrote in this short review.
5 The Prophet Almustafa waits in the city of Orphalese for his ship to take him home.  For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers.  He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon.  &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love?  Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.  Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.  The profoundness of his truth is not gleaned until the words are read many times.  The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is extraordinary, and will always be one of my favorite books of philosophy, poetry, wisdom, mysticism, and prose.Victoria Tarrani
5 Gibran's Prophet is the best example of how simple prose can be used to convey deep and powerful statement. As the name suggests, the book just recounts some sermons given by a prophet. The themes discussed include love, family, friendship, freedom, etc. This is one of those classsics that one must own and read every once in a while, for the wisdom in these words is bound to make every reader a better, completer person. It is a spiritual prose, full of deep insight and inspiration for one and all.Some qoutes that I particularly like:And ever it has been that love knows not his own depth until the hour of separation.When love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep.Work is love made visible.Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy can it contain.Your house is your larger body.And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than thier misdeeds.For reason, ruling alone is a force confining;And passion, unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction.Your pain is breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.For self is a sea, boundless and measureless.For vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.In longing for your giant self lies your goodness and that longing is in all of you.Trust your dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.
5 The Prophet is one of those books that you refer to often over the years.  And to have it on my Kindle, so I can take it anywhere, is a real treat!
5 I admire the philosophy of this author. This book is ageless and inspirational, should be one of those mandatory books for high school.
5 Beautifuly written book, and as you read it again over the years you find more and more meaning in it.
1 "The Prophet" is Almustafa, called "the chosen and the beloved," who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as "Prophet of God" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which "the Prophet" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of "inspirational fiction" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran's writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran's theology, "the Prophet" says, "Say not, `I have found the truth,' but rather, `I have found a truth.'"  Jesus said, "You shall know THE truth" (John 8:32), and, "I am the way, THE truth, and the life" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa's discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a "spiritual masterpiece," so when I found it in my father's library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, "Ugh."  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, "It's all Greek to me," but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were "all Greek" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I'll just say it's all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet "brings to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes."  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn't mean that there's nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can't be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what "the Prophet" says about clothes.  "Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment."  Oh, by the way, even as simply "poetry" it just doesn't do anything for me.  It is not a book that I would recommend to anyone under any circumstances.
5 Book offers amazing Philosphy and at the same time delivers perspective on any thing life. The Prophet is a must read.
5 My mother read this book a long time ago and recommended it to me but I never read it. I just recentlyu read in (June 2006) and glad I finally did. This book short essays on the different aspects of life. These are teachings and they are meant to inspire and advise. They are written in such a way so that the words are not rammed down your throat.
5 Just reread The Prophet for the umpteenth time.  Still love it and its insights into many issues.  Great quotable texts.  Everyone should read this and reflect-not the same as agreeing--on what Gibran says.
5 Not to be confused with THE good Book. Typical eastern philosophy and good food for thought. I liked this book. I thought it was inspiring.
5 I've been a fan of this wonderful book since my college days (back in the dark ages).  It contains many wonderful thoughts that will always inspire.
5 This book could easily be a text for religious and non religious people to live by. Great remarks on death, love, life, or anything.Check it out.
5 Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a truly awe inspiring work of prosaic poetry.  Despite being a native-born Arabic speaker, Gibran wrote The Prophet in English, ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation.The work's 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey.  The words that flow from the prophet's mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life.  Chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as "On Friendship", "On Pain" and "On Death."  What unites the 28 chapters is Gibran's thought provoking and probing literary style as Gibran's prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest.  The book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity.The book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating.  Amazingly, Gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages, making it a very quick and easy read.  Readers will find themselves returning to The Prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of Gibran's words.The Prophet, which Gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece, is a timeless literary classic.  Its truth has touched generations of readers and will undoubtedly continue to do so.
3 I know Beryl Bainbrige is a great writer but...this was my first Bainbridge novel and I didn't enjoy it very much. Am I not getting it? I have so many questions unanswered by this book. Why were Dr. Potter and Myrtle suffering through the Crimean war when they didn't have to be there? Was it Myrtle's utter devotion that kept her there? Why was Potter there? Were they camp followers? Also, did Myrtle bear Georgie and his wife's children for them because the wife couldn't? Or am I dreaming? There seems so much allusion in this book and I feel dumb for not getting what the other reviewers are getting from it. For me, it wasn't clear or easy to follow and I am not a stupid person. I'm a bit disappointed but will try another book of hers and hope that I will enjoy it more..
4 A reading of this book resembles a leafing through an album of old photographs dedicated to some unknown man named George Hardy. Each of the three narrators, who were once connected and loved him (though in different  manner and degree), shows two pictures and tells their prehistories. The  image of Master Georgie as a respectable, decent man turns into a central  figure of such a weird sexual and family conundrum that it will take some  time to perceive; an affectionate son turns into a frigid father and lover;  a drunkard into a brave surgeon of the English army during the Crimean War;  etc. The book ends in horrible bloody scenes of the senseless war carnage.  Ms Beryl Bainbridge does not give an opportunity for George Hardy to speak,  so we close the book but still do not understand who and what was George  and why these three persons were so devoted to him. Just as in a real life:  people come and go, we think we know them, but we usually know only their  external appearance, and their essence remains a mystery...
2 It's difficult to know quite where to begin here, in the face of such overwhelming praise from so many satisfied readers. It's not that it's badly written, just that it fails to illuminate Master Georgie's life. That after all should be its purpose, particularly where, as here, that person existed and at least one of the events described took place. The author is content to conjure up others to act as prisms, which would be a useful literary device if they illuminated the central figure, but instead we see him through a glass darkly. I may be in a minority of one, but it failed to live up to my expectations.
3 Master Georgie is a novel set in the time of the Crimean War. Through the eyes of three people close to Master Georgie, Myrtle, a girl believed to be Georgie's sister, Dr. Potter, a geologist and Pompey Jones, the photography assistant, we follow him from Liverpool to the battlefield of the Crimean War.This way to write about a person and his happenings is well known through Ian Pears An Instance of the Fingerpost. And can be a perfect way to keep the readers interest and also the readers capability to live with the story. But Beryl Bainbridge do not master this art in this book. The language is too flat, without feelings, and the plots are sometimes too cryptical to be understood. I had to read several parts more than once to be able to understand what it all really was about, and to understand which lenses where used.Still the book has some good parts, among them are the battlefield scenes. And I also like the way Bainbridge use the meaning of the photography, to let us see snapshots of Master Georgie's life, using other people as lenses, as cameras.The book is a short one, less than 200 pages, and the surprising ending helps to give meaning to the story.Britt Arnhild Lindland
5 Historic fiction requires exceptional skills to capture character as well as time and place. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie certainly excels in this regard, reminding me of the skills of Hilary Mantel. The plight of a Crimean War surgeon comes alive in all its gore and misery and insanity. The tale is told through the eyes of the surgeon's brother-in-law, his off and on boyfriend and photographic assistant, and Myrtle, an orphan informally adopted by the family and mother of his children. The Crimean War offers a backdrop of incompetent diplomatic and military leadership dissolving into a nightmare of gore, horror, disease, dysentery, crime, and cruelty. Bainbridge captures the disorganized international disaster with many horrible bloody details, having her characters do the best they can to survive the catastrophe. Yet, Bainbridge captures more than just history, time, place, and character for her writing is poetic and her attention to detail is superb. Early in the novel, Myrtle cleans the dog hair off of a tiger skin rug and as she pulls the white dog hairs from the brush, they float like dandelion seed up the wind-draft of the staircase and nestle on the chandelier. It is such details that make the book beautiful and horrible at the same time. The pace of the book is excellent and she moves the reader from critical chapter to chapter in the lives of the main characters. I almost think she wrote too little in this book. I would have loved to have the book twice as long. The character of Pompey Jones, the bisexual street urchin, is fascinating and I wish Bainbridge had written a novel just for this self-aware, self-assured, character to follow Master Georgie. Bainbridge actually focuses much of the novel on the character of Myrtle, and we learn as much about her amazing strength of character as we do about that of her sometime lover George Hardy. Myrtle and Pompey are both orphans, street wise, highly intelligent, and are recognized for their strengths by the Hardy family.George Hardy is never fully explained and made visible to the viewer for his motives are somewhat hidden. As a homosexual or bisexual physician from an upper class home, it appears that his service in the Crimean is somewhat of a penance, a sacrifice, for his sexuality. He strives to be the perfect son to his father, mother, and siblings, yet the secret of his sexuality means that a critical part of him must be hidden from his family. George Hardy appears to sacrifice himself during the Crimean War due to his sexual orientation over which he has no control. In some ways this is also a study of gay guilt in the Victorian period and the mechanisms and strategies undertaken to atone for an unacceptable sexual orientation. George is contrasted with Pompey who seems much more at home with his bisexuality, recognizing it as more a part of himself and as an asset by which he can manipulate both men and women. The narrative of war is haunting, reminding me of the outstanding novels of Pat Barker about World War I. We read of handsome shirtless soldiers dying from eating unwashed cherries or horses bleeding to death while standing with bullet holes through their body. It is the third narrator, Dr. Potter, George's brother-in-law that offers unique looks at all the other characters. Potter is intellectual and foolish at the same time. He lacks practicality but his power of observation is evident. Overall the book is excellent, a post-modern masterpiece, telling a complex tale from multiple points of view but never giving the `definitive' story behind the story.
4 I'd heard so much about Bainbridge...how she has been nominated (and overlooked) for the Booker five times...how her short novels are beloved by a cultish following. So I grabbed Master Georgie while on a business trip  and buried myself in its atmosphere. I don't think I've read anyone like  her. One of the reviewers here compared the experience to browsing through  a collection of photos, and that is true. Somewhat frustrating, though, is  that - as with aged photographs - you never quite get the feeling that you  know these characters or have their full stories. Maybe if Beryl Bainbridge  were sitting alongside me to fill in the gaps. Nevertheless, I'm ready to  plunge into another Bainbridge and am curious to know if anyone else has  favorites.
2 The news of the death of Beryl Bainbridge last year made me want to read books by a very accomplished writer. In our book club we chose to read Master Georgie.This was a great disappointment. We should have asked for advice on what books to read. The book was nominated for the Booker prize in 1998, but did not win the award.While there is an interesting historical episode as the background, and there were different viewpoints, the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read. At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives. This did not happen.So need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of Beryl Bainbridge
2 I finished this book as fast as I could. I felt the author was on another wavelength to the reader. I didn't care that the story was about this Georgie fellow. He seemed peripheral and the written perspective on him  oblique. The writing was good and I may try some other of the authors works  but the plot was feeble. Try Pat McCabe's breakfast on Pluto for energy and  a raw story or Ian McEwan's Amsterdam for a page turner with a plot of some  interest. Thumbs down for this one.
4 In a revolving first person narrative, three people who are close to George narrate the events of their mid-nineteenth century life. These narrations center around photographs taken at certain points. Through the course of the novel the idea of an image taken is made increasingly more complex as is the mystery of George who is most often portrayed idealistically as a man of high knowledge and wisdom. Through the carefully written language of the narrative, there are surprisingly human incidents and facts revealed that are startlingly human. These are placed in the frame of the historical context leading to the war between England and Russia. The gruesome events of the war that follow strip each of the three characters of their pretence and leaves them yearning for the image of their lost ideal, Master George. This is a fascinating experiment in looking at ways of perception, the identities they fashion for people and the personal impact of assumptions about other people's identities.
4 Geroge Hardy, a surgeon and amateur photographer, discovers his father dead in the bed of another woman and hastens to bring the body home before his mother learns of it.  Three people help with this task, and their lives are irrevocaly changed because of it.The story is told through the eyes of those three people close to Master Georige.  The first is Myrtle, a young orphan who is accepted and raised by the Hardy family.  She immediately falls in love with Georgie, a love that will carry her from the streets of Liverpool to the battlefields of the Crimean War.  Next is Pompey Jones, a young street boy who helps move the body of George's father and then discovers George's passion for young men.  The last is Dr. Potter, a family friend who follows George all the way to the Battle of Inkermann, never understanding George's aversion to women or why he wants to attach himself to a unit during the awful war.  Through their eyes, we watch George change from a young doctor in England dealing with his father's troublesome death to the hardened field doctor trying to save lives during a time of war.This is a fantastic historical novel, with some of the most descriptive war scenes I've read in quite some time.  Bainbridge makes you feel the confusion, fear and dread that the soldiers faced both due to battle and due to disease.  At the same time, she shows how one life can effect others, either for better or for worse.  A highly engrossing novel.
4 I was attracted to this mesmerizing novel by its meditations on 19th century photography, Victorian middle-class hypocrisy and the Crimean War. Photography binds this brief novel together and Bainbridge revels in its  historical and metaphorical possibilities. She organizes her chapters  around photographs, which makes the reader immediately aware that she/he is  to infer meaning from this practice and speculate on the role of  photography in determing what and how we see and remember. Bainbridge is  very sensitive to and aware of 19th century photography: its use during the  Crimean War (the first war that photographs were taken of), connection to  both science and magic, and the practice of post-mortem photography. The  reader does have to work to explore the themes suggested by the author, but  her historical grounding, lucid prose and rich subject make the effort  worthwhile.
4 Bainbridge is simply a genius.Master Georgie is a classic.An entralling read,full of off beat characters whose hope and dreams are tragically mistimed.Their miserable lives entwined poetically reaching a climax in a  wasteful war. A brilliantly gripping ripping yarn of a story subtly and  savagely told by a master.
5 A masterful evocation of a time and a war that took place 150 years ago and life's little ironies that brought these characters together in the first place to determine their fate.
4 At first, I was going to tick Beryl Bainbridge off for writing too well, too literary.  I thought it nonsense that an illiterate girl in nineteenth century Liverpool could never write such exquisite prose as evidenced in  this novel, and that this was a case of the authorial voice being too  strong.  As it happened, I couldn't have been more wrong.  This novel is  narrated by the close acquaintances of 'Master Georgie' (although some are  closer than others), starting with the illiterate Myrtle.  Immediately we  are drawn into the action, as this sequence of a photograph being taken  will resound throughout the novel.  'Master Georgie' is incredibly subtle,  and it is only by looking back over it that you begin to appreciate that  this is the most suitable of beginnings.  Here is where Myrtle begins on  her road to becoming a lady.  And what an unsavory road it is, as Myrtle's  help is initially required to cover up the manner in which George Hardy's  father has died, and leads to the bloody battlefields of the Crimea.  Also  assisting with the cover-up is the duck-boy and street urchin, Pompey Jones  and the pompous Dr. Potter, whose narrations are by far the best.  George  Hardy himself is an ambiguous figure, seen only through the eyes of others.  It may be a fault that we never really get to know him.  This is a novel  of cameras, carnality, and carnage.  The dreadful shadow of history is cast  upon it, with the famous charge of the Light Brigade lightly alluded to.  One almost expects to run into a lady with a lamp at every corner, but  fortunately, Bainbridge avoids this excess.  She takes events frozen in  time, such as the front cover's photograph, and brings them into life and  death, and maybe even beyond.  The camera never lies... Or does it?  Bainbridge fervently burrows into the psyche of characters, enabling them  to bring about apparitions vivid enough to be captured by film.  In my  mind's eye, I see Bainbridge pouring over ancient photographs from the  Crimea, trying to put names to faces and to see if she could walk around in  their bloody shoes.  She succeeds.  If I'd have been on 1998's Booker  panel, I know I would have placed Bainbridge before McEwan.  And the reason  wouldn't have the desire to give her a consolatory, but demeaning, long  service award.  In this instance, 'Master Georgie' speaks for itself.
4 At first glance Master Georgie by Beryl Bainbridge suggests it might be quite a light book, an easy read, a period piece set in the mid-nineteenth century. This would be wrong. Master Georgie is no safe tale of country house manners, of marriages imagined by confined, embroidering young women. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie is anything but a tale of such saccharine gentility.Master Georgie is a surgeon and photographer, and the book is cast in six plates - photographic plates, not chapters. Death figures throughout. From start to finish morbidity crashes into the lives of the book's characters. We begin with Mr Moody, dead in a brothel bed, his host of minutes before in shock. Later we move to the Crimean War, where the carnage is graphic, extensive and apparently random. And even then individuals find their own personal ways of adding insult and injury to the suffering.The book uses multiple points of view. We see things Master Georgie's way. Myrtle, an orphan he takes in, adds her perspective. The fussy geologist, Dr Potter, imprints his own version of reality. And still there are less than explained undercurrents, undeclared motives which affect them all. Thus, overall, Master Georgie is a complex and ambitious novel. Though it is set in a major war, the backdrop is never allowed to dominate. The characters experience the consequences of conflict and register their reactions, but we are never led by the nose trough the history or the geography of the setting.But we also never really get to know these people. Myrtle, perhaps, has the strongest presence. She has a slightly jaundiced, certainly pragmatic approach to life. But even she finds the privations of wartime tough. Why the characters of Master Georgie are all so keen to offer themselves as support for the war effort is an aspect of the book that never fully revealed itself. And ultimately this was my criticism of Beryl Bainbridge's book. While the overall experience was both rewarding and not a little shocking, I found there was insufficient delineation between the characters and their differing motives. The beauty of the prose, however, more than made up for any shortcoming. The language created the mixed world of mid-nineteenth century politeness and juxtaposed this with the visceral vulgarities of soldiering and the general struggle of life. This rendered Master Georgie a complex, moving and quite beautiful book.
4 It is amazing how some writers can blather on for hundreds of pages and yet be barren of memorable phrase or image, yet how a select few demonstrate the maxim of &quot;less is more.&quot;  Beryl Bainbridge and  her most recent novel Master Georgie surely fall into this latter category.  Each chapter in this short (190 pages) novel takes its title from a  picture illustrating its contents.  This is an effective technique, as the  photographic image provides both a jumping-off point for Bainbridge's  particular scene and narrator (the novel is given from several points of  view) and a framing device for the scene. I look forward to more of her  fiction.
2 The back cover of this book praises Beryl Bainbridge for her &quot;deadpan prose&quot; and her &quot;emotionless sentences&quot;. It's ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer. It is these very faults that bring about the ruin of MASTER GEORGIE.The novel spans the years 1846-1854. Master Georgie, or George Hardy,  is the young son of a rich Liverpool merchant. He is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story. That is left up to three other characters. One of these is Myrtle, an orphan who was taken in by the Hardys as a child and is deeply in love with George. She follows him in his restless wanderings of Liverpool. One night, in a sordid episode they find George's father dead in the bed of a prostitute. Along with another character who does narration, Pompey Jones (a street hustler), they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family. The three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives, and as the novel progresses this deepens into love, both sexual and spiritually. It becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction. The last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric Dr. Potter who has a hankering for George's sister. Nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life, he dwells instead in books, mainly the classical writers of Rome and Greece. When you start a conversation with him, he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you. Towards the latter part of the book, all the characters become involved in the Crimean War. Or actually George becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him. Just like all wars, this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders.The parts of the book set in Liverpool are quite good and interesting. They seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes. The books problem lies in the deadpan writing. It's like watching the stand up comedy of Steven Wright, where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion. It's the same thing here. We are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement. The closer I got to the end, the more bored I got. I skipped over some pages to get to the end. I didn't care about the character's fates. I just wanted to say i finished it.
4 Ms. Beryl Bainbridge writes Historical Fiction with as much skill as any writer, and much better than others who attempt the genre. Her stories rarely have definitive separations between what actually happened, and what might have happened to the characters she creates. The Crimean War is the setting this time, and while historically noteworthy is not as familiar as some of her other subjects, like The Titanic, or the doomed Scott Expedition to the South Pole. What is consistent is her ability to jump about through time periods without ever losing credibility. Each of her books reads as if a unique pen is behind each one. The hand of course is the same, however the moods created are remarkably singular.The character that is the book's title is a complex human study, or if you prefer, a very intricate person but occupied with a mind and personality as muddled, as it is diverse. A grotesque death scene is the entrance for one of the narrator's of the book, an individual that would have lived as a street urchin but for chance, and an ambiguous bit of goodwill. A second street personality with many more wiles and flexible conduct also becomes a member of Master Georgie's entourage. This second narrator has a unique view of events, as he is close when Master Georgie requires, for the latter's sexuality is repressed at best. These are just two people who eventually head to the middle of The Crimean War, and the question that keeps shadowing the reader is why?Escape from the latter half of 19th century London is an easy answer for George, but what of the others? Taking a trip toward an impending war as George's groupies is one matter, staying in the midst of a war is much more puzzling. This is one of the most difficult of Ms. Bainbridge's books that I have read. Previous works have often served as a metaphor for the time they occupy, or the closing act in a World that is about to undergo great disruptive change. This work is not as apparently decisive.One characteristic is consistent, and that is her master's grasp of language. A lapful of cherries that serve as a metaphor will haunt a reader for some time. Her images of the dead and dying are less grotesquely graphic than most writers portray, but are far more disturbing than other wartime battles. This may not be the best of her work if it is the first of hers you experience, however if you can successfully decipher this one, that are several others that are much more comfortable to read.
5 Clarence Larkin has a great way of communicating &#34;hard&#34; to understand passages.  I have a friend who recommended him this spring.
5 This is a wonderful book to study with The Greatest Book on  Dispensational Truth in the World  by Clarence Larkin.
5 Clarence Larkin is the best interpreter of the Bible.  His hand drawn charts and exceptional.  I have all of his books and charts.
5 This book is well written and very organized. The author did an excellent job of explaining a complicated subject and I was surprised at how easy it was to read. It was so interesting and informative that couldn't put the book down once I started to read it. I purchased four more books of different titles and read them with the same ease. It's not that the subject is any easy read but it was so clearly explained and flowed very nicely as it untangled many questions that I had concerning prophecy. I purchased this title for a friend of mine and highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Bible prophecy.
5 Larkin published several books on Biblical studies.in the 1910's and 20's. Revelation has a constant narrative with a beginning, middle and end. It is also one of the essential sacred texts and required reading for anyone interested in religion.This book is a great reference whether they are &#34;dispensationalists&#34; on not. Highly recommended reading. Thanks Amazon
4 A must read. One book of the bible that's a mastery is Revelation and this book my be of great help. Pick it up and see what I mean.
5 This book by Clarence Larkin was given as a gift, and I understand that the person who received it is very pleased with the teaching as it is presented clearly and precisely. It arrived when promised, and I am very pleased with the condition and the packaging.
5 This is another wonderful book by Clarence Larkin. It was a gift for my husband since this is one of his favorite authors.He said it was an interesting  and informative book.
5 I now know who the Anti Christ is.  He perfectly fits what the scriptures have to say about him.  It is to complicated to explain there, but he stands ready right now to assume his role, which tells me the rapture is imminent.  When I saw that my heart skipped a beat.  GET READY!!!!
5 Without a doubt, IMHO, this book has got to be one of the best ever done on the last book of the Bible and how those thing written there relate to other prophetic books of the Bible (Especially the book of Daniel) and history. It is beautifully written and has many detailed charts and pictures. What is really cool is to realize this book was done in the early 1900's, before The Jewish people went back home and reclaimed the land God promised them. I loved this book and it confirmed the truth found within the Bible. RMS
5 THANK YOU FOR BEING SO PROMPT IN SENDING MY BOOK.  MY PASTOR IS ALWAYS GIVING US SOMETHING TO LOOK UP AND WITH MY BOOKS I AM ALWAYS READY TO SEARCH OUT THE ANSWERS.  THANK YOU FOR MY BOOKS ALWAYS BEING IN GREAT SHAPE AND NICE AND CLEAN AND NO TORN PAGES OR THE BOOKS ALL MARKED UP.
5 I referred to this book a lot when I was teaching on the Book of Revelation. I would highly recommend this book if you want to study the end times. Very interesting and helpful.
1 How people can make these types of mistakes is beyond me. There appears to have been no editor or proofreading before putting this up for sale and apparently no quailty control measures on Amazon's part. The problems:1. 4,500 locations or 450 pages are missing. This ebook is 500 locations or 50 pages.2. The reviews posted on the &#34;Kindle Store&#34; were clearly for the hard copy version3.  This &#34;book&#34; give a page or two &#34;outline&#34; of a topic. Example- there is no information detailing the seven churches like in the hard copy version just a 2 page turn &#34;outline&#34; saying the Book of Revelations speaks about seven churches.4. Complete information is just missing. The table of content looks consistent with the hard copy version yet once you spend $3.99 to buy it and click on a TOC link subtiles are not there.5. This ebook is just a very brief overview of what is in the Book of Revelations and what is in Larkin's actual book.I will be getting a refund from Amazon.
5 great book.  clarence larkin does a great job with this book in explaining revelations and makes it easy to understand
4 I just recently started studing this book.  I have enjoyed what I have read so far, but I have too many other books going to really get the full benefit out of it.
5 Haven't really got to the content of it yet. However, I love this big size book, cover, and the wide margins. Highlighter ready!
5 Be advised, this is a very deep book and should not be approached lightly. Though I believe every believer should own the book, someone still on the milk of the Word of God will struggle with the deep things of God covered in this book.
5 This book is amazing. The charts really make it! I am so happy to have this for a study guide. Thanks, Amazon!
5 All,This is the version of this book that you want.  An excellent book, and good to get your thoughts going.
5 I  got my first copy of this book back in 1961. It was one of the first printed (very old at that time) and was in a scroll type layout. I have since bought three more over the years to give to friends. If you are interested in Bible study, Give this a shotGREAT
5 Our purchase of this book is a repeat...we loaned ours and never received it back...it's that good!  The informational is according to the Bible and a timely resource.
5 Again received this prior to estimated delivery date. For those who are interested in a great analysis of Biblical Facts, the charts in this are clear, comprehensive and are an excellent way of following God's Plan of the Ages.
5 This is a wonderful looking book, I have not had a chance to start reading it, however the drawings alone are beyond great. The book arrived within three days of ordering, and the book is in great shape.
5 Good book in fact a great book taught me things that I never heard of before. Excellent book for seekers. Priced  right it is one of my favorite books. I wish that the print were larger but it is dark so I can read it with glasses. It is not too large to carry in your purse to pull out and read in a waiting room .I am recommending it to any person who hungers to understand the Bible better
5 I must say this book is very deep, it is not something you pick up and read all the way through at one sitting.  If you get through a Chapter, you are really very intelligent.  This book is really heavy and I still have it on my nightstand.  Read a couple of pages and put it down.  It gives you much to think about, mull over, chew on it.  Enjoy, the light will eventually go on, I hope!Betty
5 I have  read hundreds of books explaining different aspect of the bible for over 20 years,  but this is the best one yet. It keeps to the bible and to the point. Clarence Larkins is amazing writer and his charts just add extra understanding to his work. This man was truly used of God for this book.
3 I find this a little difficult to follow, but that could just be me.  I would prefer more concise information.
5 ORDERED THIS BOOK FOR MY HUSBAND.  HE WAS SO HAPPY TO RECEIVE IT AND HE SHOWED IT TO OUR PASTOR AND NOW HE WANTS ONE.  I AM SO HAPPY TO BE ON THIS SITE.  EVERYTIME I NEED SOMETHING, I COME TO THIS SITE AND I CAN ALWAYS FIND WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR.  THANK YOU.  IT COMES IN GREAT SHAPE AND ALWAYS ARRIVE IN GOOD CONIDITION.
5 This book is an excellent book to read in addition to the Bible.  If you have some knowledge of the Bible you will find this book offers some additional insight that is not in other commentaries. This author is an inspiration to me to dig deeper in the word of God.  Because it is written in 1929 do not let that cause you to think it is old school and outdated.  It is not!  I am still reading it as it is too much information to ingest in a couple days.  The book starts off with an explanation that the Bible was written "for all classes of people and for our learning" and the Bible is not addressed to all people in general. Part of the Bible is to addressed to the Jews, Gentiles and to the Church which consititute the three classes. Mr. Larkin gives his explanation of the ages and dispensations. He continues on to explain the age of the earth that in Gen 1:3-31 was the restoration of the earth to its original condition before it was made "formless and void" and submerged in water and darkness and how there is millenniums of time that science may require for the formation of the earth as a planet. His teachings throughout the book are thought-provoking and shed some light on questions I have had such as election and free-will, Heaven and Hell, Judiaism and Christianity. It is 328 pages of Biblical explanations and charts. I definitely find this a must read.
5 ISBN 0394826922 - I'd already read and reviewedI'll Teach My Dog a Lot of Words (Bright & Early Board Books(TM))when this, the unabridged version, fell into my lap. While I think the shorter, abridged version is a great introduction, this is what you want those little readers building up to!A young, faceless, pet owner plans to teach his dog 100 words, impressing the entire town - including the mayor. Simple words like "walk" and "beg" are only the beginning of the plan. He also intends to teach him "stand on Uncle Abner's thumb" and "paint the road from here to there"... Plans, however, are one thing; getting started is quite another.Author Michael Firth is fantastic, as usual, with simple language made extraordinarily fun. P. D. Eastman's illustrations are perfect - they're fun and funny and complement the text. Kids will laugh and learn and that, to be honest, is who we're really interested in teaching!- AnnaLovesBooks
5 This is a classic. Funny lines, great rhymes and rhythm, engaging pictures, and an appealing main character. If a parent loves to read it as much as a toddler loves to hear it, that's the sign of a great book.
5 I enjoy reading these books with my 2YO. The words are short, the illustrations are entertaining and the story doesn't drag on to bore him. He is able to turn the pages and tell me the story by just looking at the pictures! He is especially fascinated by the animals- goose, moose, mouse, pig...and always giggles at &#34;kick the stone&#34;- for whatever reason. Lol.I am completely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this as an addition to any toddler's bookshelf!If you do buy this and it's a hit, consider alsoGo, Dog! Go!Are you my mother?Big Dog, Little Dog
5 A timeless classic my two year old loves. I appreciate these books so very greatly as unlike some other popular children's books these include real words and objects... so very refreshing!
1 I didn't realize this was the children's book in the Dr. Seuss series. I thought it was for adults. My mistake and I had to laugh at myself when I excitedly opened it up. I couldn't teach my dog any new tricks! :)
5 Beginning with &quot;The first six words I'll teach my pup are 'dig a hole' and 'fill it up.'&quot;  this book is absolutely hilarious.  I had never heard of it before my son came along, but it is one of his favorites  and mine.  It is whimiscal, clever, and just plain fun:  &quot;have a care,  don't paint the mayor.&quot;  The cadence and flow of the words are  masterful.This nugget will surprise you.  I hope you enjoy it.
5 This is a great kid's book -- one of the best "fake Dr. Seuss books" in the Beginner's Book series.  The story is fast paced and funny, and the words roll right off the page.  Way cooler than "Go, Dog. Go!"  Recommended!
5 A delight for any young child, this wonderful book is filled with bright and cheerful illustrations , as well as fun rhyming.It is full of life and action in only 29 pages.It teaches small children, the meaning of words, as they are taught to the dog.Finally it teaches the meaning of procrastination, as the owner of the dog, with all his big dreams for his pet, on the last page says:&#65533;I think I&#65533;ll start next year&#65533;
5 My kiddos never get tired of hearing this story. The illustrations are cute, and the book is fun to read aloud. Great for bedtime or story time!
5 I had this book for my children when they were small. My daughter who is in her 30s wanted me to order to read to the grandsons.
5 This is a cute book about all the words that the kid (filled with ambitious enthusiasm) wants to teach his dog. This incredible dog would dazzle and inspire even the mayor to say "let's make today a holiday!" Oh, what an endeavor this will be!
4 My grandson will like the idea that he could teach his dog some words.  He will probably try to do just that.
5 I loved this book as a child and now I love it for my own daughter.I have vivid memories of a time when I could just newly read and barely count ...staying up well past my bedtime, writing down all the words that were new to the dog (i.e. not counting "a" more than once) and trying to count them to see if the book really had 100 words (it did!).  It was that engaging.  I remember it took me hours, and then when my mom caught me still awake, I lied and told her I had just woken up.The point in that is that as a small child, I found this book so intriguing that I was reading, writing, and counting for fun, well past my bedtime.  As an adult, I love the wit.  As a parent, I love that I get to share the childlike love for it all over again.This is such a fun book with real learning potential too.  Love it.
5 I read this book to my children when they were young and now am reading it to my grandchildren. It's one of their favorites, as it was my own childrens'. Even after 30 years, I still remember most of the book, I read it so often!
5 ESPECIALLY good for those beginners who are inspired to read about dogs! The kid I work with loved it, and we had a lot of fun with it.
5 for getting your kid introduced to his/her ABC's. I also have the Berenstain Bear's A Book and C Book. My kids love the funny pictures and topical sentences.
3 This Book is funny and is full of B words, like "big brown bear, blue, bull, beautiful baboon...."  Another B phrase is added each time so by the end it's a long phrase.  There is a surprise at the end for a sad Baby Bird.  (my daughter dictated that paragraph)This isn't Berenstain Bear family book, with Mama, Papa, Sister and Brother but is a celebration of an important letter.  It's fun to read out loud with a swingy feel to it.
5 A favorite Berenstain book of my children I was happy to find it for my grandson.
5 This book is quite funny.  Especially when you read it fast as I'm always requested to do.  How fast can you read, "big brown bear, blue babboon, beautiful babboon blowing bubbles, biking backward, bump black bug's banana boxes..." And and it goes from there!  It's really fun to read aloud and plus it's easy for little ones to memorize.  A very cute book, and a very easy way to teach the letter 'b'.  Great book - ours gets taken to bed!
5 Teaching the next generation to love books!  My grandson is really enjoying this book. It was as funny this time as with my children.
5 My family discovered this book when my younger brother was the age for picture books, and we all loved it.  In fact, we can still quote it by heart.The book is really just a list of things that start with the letter B, but the Berenstains have managed to create a story that's a lot of fun with it.  We follow the results when a bear, a bull, and a baboon blow bubbles and bike backwards.  What happens?  Well, they bump into all kinds of things.  And the more they bump, the more absurd the book gets and the more fun it truly is.As I said, we all loved this book.  It was clever and charming and so out there you can't help but laugh at it.  Each page pretty much repeats what came before while adding a new layer to the chaos.  And the illustrations capture what is happening perfectly.This is a true classic picture book.  If you can find a copy, you're family will love it.
3 We bought this after our daughter loved the 'A' book so much. It was a great title for a learning reader and it's simple vocabulary and engaging illustrations made us regret that the series stopped with 'the C book'.
5 I read this book to my children 35 & 38 years ago and they loved it.  My new 14 month old grandson loves it as well bringing it to read to him many times a day.  Alliterative and repetitive, when read with expression, it is great fun for us all.  I think it is out of print so I was delighted to find this.
4 During the night, my little boy tipped over his toy bin and used it to scale his bookshelves. This morning there were a pile of about twenty books on the floor and he wanted me to read every one of them. For the most part, he would lose interest after a page or two, but a few he listened to right until the end. Those books deserve a write-up.That he listened all the way through The Berenstains' B Book surprised me. I did lose interest after about the fourth page, but he was loving all those Bs, so I read it to the end. This is a silly little book, which, not shockingly emphasizes the letter B. It becomes quite a tricky tongue-twister long before you reach the end of the book. I couldn't really tell you what specifically my three-year-old liked about the book, but he did really enjoy it.The illustrations feature the funnel-snouted animals of the Berenstains -- cute and colorful, but not easily recognizable, and, therefore not my favorite style. Again, my little boy liked all the silly images and colors, even if he didn't believe me that the bear was supposed to be a bear.
5 This is one of the best first readers to start your little ones' library with. I read this so many times to my kids that I knew it by heart. It is a FUN..way to share time with your little loved ones.
5 The text consists of words beginning with B with a minimum of any other words.  This is a great idea for teaching beginning readers, and I wish there were more books like this.The illustrations are cute and the the story is funny.  In other words, it's by the Berenstains.If you like the Berenstains, and if you like picture books with alliterative text, then you have two good reasons to try C is for Clown, 0001714422.
5 I remember this beloved book from when I was a child and first learning to read. I loved it then, as I do now. I recently bought a replacement copy FOR MYSELF, as my children misplaced it somewhere along the way. My lady asked me for whom I was purchasing the book and I responded truthfully, "Me." Gotta love the Berenstain Bears! I do, and I'm 47! I find myself often reciting the book whenever I'm feeling the need for a little lift of my mood and a spontaneous smile. Indulge yourself and any little ones in your life. You won't regret owning this classic.
5 This book is so cute and so much fun! We borrowed this book from our local library and then I just had to own it. My kids didn't want to return it to the library. The story line is so cute and it rhymes too which gives it a fun rhythmic sound as you read it aloud. Great book!
1 Awkward cadence, lacks the usual old school Berenstain Bear charm (I despise the newer preachy books but expected this one to be up there with the great The Bear's Picnic.) The illustrations might be worth half a star but it's truly so dreadful I can't bring myself to go over a single star.
4 This book was a used book which was in excellent condition was very please with this purchase kids love these books.
5 &quot;The Berenstain Bears on the Moon,&quot; by Stan and Jan Berenstain, is one of the best in the authors' excellent series of children's books. In this installment, Brother and Sister Bear, accompanied by their excitable pet dog, take a rocket trip to the moon and back.Although the book's primary purpose is entertainment and literacy education, the Berenstains do get some of the science right. The portray the gravity-free environment of the space ship's interior during the voyage, and they also show that the gravity on the lunar surface is much less than that on Earth.The book is illustrated in the typically appealing Berenstain Bears style. Particularly fun is the orange, green, and purple-colored rocket ship used by the intrepid space travelers. And the rhymes are equally fun. Example: &quot;Two little bears / and one little pup. / They are off to the moon, / going up, up, up!&quot; This irresistible adventure tale is definitely a high point in a beloved book series.
2 I love the Berenstain Bears, but this book stinks.  This is the only book of theirs that I rank low.  I grew up with the Berenstein Bear's books and love their illustrations and messages, but this one lacks in content and craftsmanship.  Buy every other Berenstein Bear book out there but skip this one.
5 Although Amazon advertises this book for ages 4-8, my wife and I started reading this and other Stan and Jan Berenstain books to our children from 18 months and up. Always a delight, our kids would laugh at the silliness while learning a lesson about life. We started a great habit of reading two or three books before bed, and the kids loved them. Soon, they would memorize many of the phrases, beginning a lifelong passion for reading.Every kid should experience reading books by the Berenstains while growing up. The characters are well developed, the rhyming phrases help kids become enthusiastic about reading, and the messages about life make them think.  Bears On The Moon got my son and daughter asking questions about space and interested in the great beyond.  Combine this with other fun Berenstain Bear books and your kids will sit enthralled as you turn the pages. Highly recommended.
4 Another one of the Berenstain Bears Early Readers.It's a lot of fun to read, and the rhymes work well. Very bouncy. I do have to suspend the disbelief of even the kidlets a little - they know full well that two children and a dog cannot go to the moon alone! - but that's all right.
3 It is a wonderful story to tell, and I am sure it is loosely written on fact vs. fiction.  But I found it dragged on and on and just lost interest until I finally I had to put it down, unfinished.  I don't do that very often.
5 A beautiful book. So wonderfully written that savoring the words was a joy, never mind the sensitive yet powerful story. Though the topics -- deafness, World War One -- suggest a very grim work, it ends up being a powerful affirmation of life.This book deserves to be much more widely known than it is; it's an excellent example of how even good books deserve ample promotion, as I think that it's a lot better than some major recent best-sellers. I was pleased to see in a bookstore recently that it's won an award.
5 This is a wonderful first novel about sound, silence, deafness, communication and love. Grania is a young girl who loses her hearing at the age of five. Her guilt-ridden mother refuses to accept that she is deaf and resists adapting to reality; only Grania's loving grandmother saves her from a life of illiteracy and loneliness. Grania is taught to read with &quot;The Sunday Book,&quot; a precious gift from her grandmother that becomes a metaphor for life's struggles and complications as Grania emerges from childhood, attends school, and meets &quot;Chim,&quot; a hearing man who loves her stillness. Just married, Grania must return home to wait while Jim goes to war as a stretcher bearer.Once again, WWI emerges as incredibly pointless and bloody, as men are thrown into the confusion of the European front. Jim experiences the war as a haze of brutal sound. He steels himself to the sight of mutilated men blown apart, but cannot stand the sight of their hands, which of course for him had become the instruments of his personal &quot;language of love&quot; with Grania. Meanwhile at home, a beloved friend from Grania's childhood who became her sister's husband returns home, mute from a horror no one can imagine. Drawing on the foundation of love from her grandmother, the deaf Grania not only coaches him back to speech but heals her sister as well. The end of the novel feels tantalizingly like only the beginning for these wonderful multi-dimensional characters.Itani is a wonderful writer, and manages to convey to those of us who hear what it's like not to be able to--she also shows what we the hearing might be missing! The background on the theories of language and teaching the deaf was fascinating, and Itani must have done some meticulous research. This is a wonderful novel well worth your time.
3 The first part of this novel was a superb 99 pages.  My enjoyment of these 99 pages is what makes this a three star book despite the fact I grew too bored to finish somewhere in the middle of part three.  Here is why:Part one is about a child named Grania growing up in Canada in the late 1800's.  A bout with scarlet fever at the age of 5 has rendered her permanently deaf.  Thankfully, Grania has an understanding family, especially her grandmother, and with their patience, she learns to lip read.  I know from my own experience, lip reading is not an easy task and this book shows us just how difficult it is.  Grania struggles to see words, understand words, and even feel words.  Readers will feel her frustration, her fears, and her shame at times.  When she begins school, we see how the deaf are treated by the hearing people with less than kind hearts.  The teacher does not want to take time out of her already busy day to ensure Grania understands what is going on.  The children like to laugh at her and play games that humilate her.  Most upsetting of all is the ignorant assumption that deaf means dumb.  When Grania is sent to a deaf school to learn lip reading and sign language, we see another world.  It is a world of silence, yet friendships build and minds expand.Part two is about an adult Grania who falls in love with a hearing man named Jim.  Jim is a nice fellow, but he does not hold my interest.  I found his conversations with Grania dull and their romance a bit sappy.  My mind began to wander.Part three follows Jim as he enters World War One and the fighting he experiences or sees.  This created a problem for me, as I said earlier, Jim just didn't hold my interest.Part one seemed a novel all of its own.  The style changed after that.  I realize the story is about Grania and Jim and World War One, but it just was not written the same as part one.  I encourage people searching for deaf fiction and literature to pick this one up tho.
5 Set in the early decades of the 20th century through World War I in Onatrio, Canada and France, Deafening is two stories - the coming of age of young Grania struck totally deaf by scarlet fever at the age of 5, and what's like living with deafness - the second story the experience of her husband Jim in World War II France where most don't survive the battlefield, and what it's like for Grania and the other families back home.A multilayered story filled with the harsh realities of the world of the deaf and the world of the battlefield, and the compassion,  love and strength of the human spirit to overcome.  Itani is a wonderful writer who gets inside each of these worlds and let the reader have his and her own experience. We become involved in the lives of her characters and we feel their joys and sorrows.
3 I wanted to like this book, but I expected a lot, and found it a disappointment.  The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling.  As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions.  I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down.  Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat.  I won't recommend this book.
4 In this sensitive portrayal of love and war, author Itani reveals the life of Grania O'Neill from her earliest days in Deseronto, Canada, through her marriage to Jim Lloyd, who serves in the Ambulance Corps during World War I.  Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap.  Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using.  When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex.  By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her &quot;voice.&quot;The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium.  Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share.  In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming:  pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers.  As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they &quot;revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.&quot;The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes.  The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends.  Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying.  As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader.  Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, &quot;Sound is always more important to the hearing.&quot;  Mary Whipple
3 The title may be Deafening, but the book is anything but.  It's very quiet--too quiet.  As we try to inhabit the life and mind of Grania, deaf since the age of five from scarlet fever, we imagine what it would be like not to know when someone is approaching from behind, or to know when the speaker has changed in a conversation.  This book was just too slow-paced for me and the characters too one-dimensional.  Grania and her hearing husband Jim seem to be without fault.  More complex is Grania's sister Tress, who struggles with her emotions when her husband comes back from WWI disfigured and dysfunctional.  Another interesting character is their mother, who postpones sending Grania to a school for the deaf as long as possible, while she battles her guilt over Grania's hearing loss and seeks a cure via specialists and spiritual quests.  However, the author doesn't fully explore the inner conflicts of Tress or her mother, and we are left with a love story between two very nice people.  Jim's story is more disturbing than Grania's, actually, as he becomes a stretcher bearer during the war and sees both friends and patients blown up inches away from him on a regular basis.  His sections of the book are very moving reminders that the lives lost in wars are not just statistics.  The most moving and ironic incident is Jim's wordless interaction with a German counterpart as they both struggle to rescue their wounded on the battlefield.
5 This is my surprise book of the year. It was a gift, and I didn't quite know what to expect, but it's turned into a real winner.Spanning the years from 1902 till the end of WWI, we follow the life of Grania, a child/woman who became deaf following scarlet fever. From a loving middle-class family, she went to a boarding school for hundreds and hundreds of deaf children, grew into a self-sufficient young woman, became a nurse, and married a hearing man, Jim. He went off to war, as did her childhood friend and brother-in-law, Kenan. Improbably for that Great War, both men returned - but in very different conditions.Divided into several parts, the early chapters are Grania's education, learning to live as a deaf person in the world of the hearing. The next part is Jim's story of his war experience.Then comes Grania's ultimately successful efforts to return the power of speech to her mute and traumatized childhood friend. And finally the resolution of all the stories.This book grows on you. One of the boldest risks author Itani took was to try (successfully) to convey Grania's silent world to readers, and to imitate the understanding of sign language as well as lip reading for those of us unfamiliar with the Deaf World.It's a stunning and powerful book, showing the power of Story to convey love, union, and understanding - and ultimately, joy.
4 I really enjoyed &#34;The Deafening.&#34;  I read it after reading another book by Itani which I really enjoyed.  Like most Americans I don't know as much about Canada as I should.  The novel grabbed my attention at the beginning and held it to the end.  It also made me feel so lucky that I have my hearing.  The scenes of the hardships of the men fighting WW1 were difficult to read, but that is war and I think it is something we all should think about.
5 A great novel!This  book, by Francis Itani, revolves around the world of a girl/woman who as acquired deafness through childhood illness. The setting is initially in Ontario, Canada in the late 1800's and then eventually alternating between Ontario and the European theater of World War I.I must admit I had some difficultly getting into this work, but I persevered and I'm glad I did, because this book is truly a magnificent read. Once committed, I could barely stand to put the book down.As with all great books, what makes this book special, is the quality of the writing.  The prose just seemed to flow effortlessly off the pages as time melted away. You learn things about deafness, quietness and darkness that you never really noticed before;  you begin to appreciate what people without hearing have to endure to get through an hour, a day or a lifetime. There were a couple of occasions in this book where I was taken aback with a new revelation regarding deafness; where I would just let this book slip to my lap and think about what I'd just read.There are parts in this book that are not for the faint of heart; some of the description of the trench warfare in France and Belgium are very graphic and disturbing. (but, most likely, accurate)All in all, a story that is quietly beautiful and at the same time beautifully sad. Really, one of my favorite books. If I had to compare it to another book for quality, beauty and heartrending appeal, then I'd pick Charles Frazier's " Cold Mountain". Both books have that intangible timeless aura to them that separate them from their peers.Highly recommended!
3 Canadian author Frances Itani had a promising idea to write about the education and early life of a girl struck deaf in infancy, as her own grandmother was at the turn of the last century. And it was an intriguing one to contrast her silent world with the cacophony of the western front in World War I. The novel that results contains interesting characters and effective passages, but it is too diffuse to really work.Grania O'Neill -- the name is an anglicization of the Irish for "love" -- loses her hearing at the age of five as a result of scarlet fever. She wakens to a world shaped and contained by words, but where language is deceptive and words have to be agonizingly relearned. She has an ally in her grandmother Mamo; the relationship between the two is the most lovely thing in the book. But I found the early chapters repetitive and could never enter fully into Grania's world. I was more interested in the relatively brief section dealing with her time at a special boarding school and the battle between the two theories of education for the deaf: sign language and the oral method.As a young adult, Grania falls in love and marries. But it is 1915, and her husband Jim goes off to war as a medical orderly. The unusual perspective makes some of the war writing quite powerful, occasionally approaching the intensity of classics such as Sebastian Faulks'BIRDSONG. And the scenes back in Canada show something even less often written about, a picture of wartime life on the home front. But the fact remains that there is an ocean between Grania and Jim, and their parallel stories barely connect. Still, a few touching episodes do manage to bridge the gap, as when one of their friends returns wounded and mute, and Grania teaches him once more to talk.This is a book that needed to dwell in language and sound, and above all in silence. It calls for an almost abstract style that can handle ideas and sensations rather than events -- poetry rather than prose. The steady narrative that Itani offers contains much that will interest and even move its readers, but for this reader at least the most exciting promises are lost.
5 It is only March and I have already voted this book for my Book of the Year Award, which I normally select toward the end of the year.  This book was beautifully written.  You could see the human emotions coming through the characters and it made me want to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen.  You feel both sorrow and joy in the characters.  Frances Itani knows the human heart and displays it so well on paper.  Great job!  I am going to make this book a part of my permanent library.
4 The true test of an author is the ability to portray the mind of someone else.  Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the "abnormal".  The young, autistic Christopher in "Curious Incident" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It's a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?Grania, who would have been "Grainne" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It's important that Grania "blend in" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.All of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a "Deaf School".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.This book cries out for a sequel.  Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]
5 If you are interested in what shaped Sir John Franklin before his abortive exploration in the Arctic, McGoogan presents a tour-de-force portrait of his second wife, Jane, an indefatigable traveler and adventurer. I read this book for insights into 19th Century Tasmania and was not disappointed. Excerpts from letters and newspapers give a clear sense of public and private reflections on this colonial period, well complimented by maps, notes, appendices, and illustrations.
5 I have just finished McGoogan's book about John Rae and his search for the northwest passage. Rae's search also found the first  proof that Franklin and his men had perished in the Arctic. Instead of gratitude, Lady Fgranklin turned on Rae and this is the next book that sheds light on this enduring tragedy. It will be an other 'can't put it down book'.
3 I ordered this book through one of Amazon Marketplace sellers as it was no longer offered by Amazon itself. While the book is in the shape I ordered it (used-very good), I have not read it yet as I only just received it after ordering in it on 11/26/10. I received the book mid January, 2011.
5 A very indepth (some think too indepth, but  I loved that) look at a very amazing person in the context of an interesting time.Some of the best historical fiction I've ever read.
5 This book, though long, chronicles an amazing lady for any historical period, but especially Victorian times.  Her wealth, influence and encouragement made wonderful human rights progress in Tasmania, formerly Van Diemen's Land, as well as in her native England.  After her captain husband was deemed lost in his search for the Northwest Passage, she spent over 20 years and millions of dollars searching for answers to what happened to him and his expedition.  In the process she made significant progress and discoveries.  A world traveller when most women rarely left there own local home areas, Lady Franklin is an inspiration for the ages.  The 'revenge' refers not only to her quest to exonerate the false slandering of Lord Franklin's good name and works, but also her victory over a harsh environment of frozen waste.  An amazing read of one amazing lady.
3 I just finished reading this book.  It is interesting to me that many of the reviews focus on his chapter on Milk.  I didn't take that much from that chapter, but simply that the verdict isn't really out on Milk.  I think he would have done better to address the question of raw or pasteurized--another big subject of debate.  But, that logically must come from the belief first that milk is good for you and I didn't really feel that he made a decisive decision about it though he leaned more towards milk than away from it.There were several things I enjoyed about this book.  I enjoyed learning a lot of nutritional history--like the history of vitamins and how different things in our food (like canola oil) were developed.  There were also interesting chapters about various vitamins.  I now finally understand why there are vitamins B6 and B12, but not B7 and B8 (they were originally named and then discarded because people realized they had no nutritional value).  There was a very interesting (to me) chapter about detox diets and the lack of scientific evidence that they do any good.  In fact, there is no evidence that there are health benefits to them.But, the reason I haven't given it 4 or 5 stars, is that the author leans heavily towards the opinion that chemicals in our food is just fine.  Even given his scientific evidence, I am not fully persuaded.  Many of the things he talked about haven't been around for years, so we don't know their long term effects.  It was just this year that several reports were published stating that artificial sweeteners are digested the same as regular sugar and do not contribute to weightloss.  Which, by the way, I was very surprised that he didn't talk about Splenda at all but he did talk about other artificial sweeteners.  I did notice after another reviewer mentioned it that studies are mentioned, but not footnoted or identified in an appendix at the back of the book.
2 Although the premise of the book is sound - to examine the accuracy of common food beliefs - the work is unimpressive and completely unhelpful. There's plenty of scientific research quoted, but some of the nutrition information and "conclusions" about various foods is wrong or terribly misleading. No matter what your interest is in reading about food and nutrition, you will be better served by skipping this book and opting for something else.
3 Near the end of the book, Joe Schwarcz quotes Mark Twain's famous maxim that "It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."  If (some of) the reviews for this book are any indication, Dr. Joe was right: scientific scrutiny is unlikely to change anyone's mind.  People continue to smoke, people continue to eat mostly red meat, etc.  Those people who eat red meat and smoke are often willing to admit they are participating in unhealthy behaviour.  So much more, then, is it difficult or impossible to convince people through the scientific literature that their preconceived notions are not correct when the topic is not something for which literally billions of people have served as experimental subjects (through their normal activities).  That is an observation that is mostly independent of the book's qualities as prose and entertainment, but it does identify the point from which this book starts.In a series of bite-sized chapters (3-5 pages), Schwarcz takes us through some of the topics he's encountered and researched in his role as a science commentator over the last 30 (?) years.  As such, I would suggest that the topics are a little skewed to the supplements side - there are many chapters devoted to particular dietary supplements with supposedly miraculous effects (to cure cancer, lose weight, etc.).  These claims are usually laughably easy to dismiss because the "evidence" of their efficacy is non-existent.  The book is much more interesting when he tackles issues of pesticides, teflon, and artificial sweeteners.  Generally, the scientific literature shows that the amounts of these items in an average diet are so small as to be non-issues.  Sure, they cause cancer - in amounts millions of times as large as humans take in.  And these amounts are far less than the naturally occurring carcinogens that we are exposed to automatically because we breath and eat food.  This leads to the primary thesis of the book, with which no nutritional expert could argue: eat a good balanced diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.This thesis is proven again and again throughout the book, and the primary problem of this book is its repetative nature.  In trying to keep each chapter reasonably autonomous, and because the conclusions are virtually the same each time, the author cannot possibly make the book entertaining for long reading times.  It's more of a "pick up, read a bit, put down for a couple days" kind of book.Other reviewers have objected to the lack of footnotes.  This is a valid criticism; I suppose it was a conscious choice on the author's and editor's parts (for ease of readability).  Certainly I would have prefered if the studies he cites were more clearly referenced.  (Rise and Fall of the Third Reich had thousands of references, so it's insulting to think that the reader would pass on buying the book simply because they are in there, especially as this book's raison d'etre is to bring to the public the objective scientific conclusions on the nutritional questions raised in the book).  I would add the criticism that two hot-button nutritional issues are not dealt with.  (1) Bisphenol-A, a monomer used in polycarbonate synthesis, has been banned by Health Canada and others, but ruled safe (in the amounts present in polycarbonate drinking and storage vessels) by the FDA.  Based on the number of articles I see (in newspapers and even the American Chemical Society's magazine), this chemical is perfectly positioned for the Dr. Joe treatment, and I find it curious that it is omitted.  (2) Perhaps because this movement has only gained real traction since the book was written it was not included, but the "eat local" mantra is in conflict with the "eat lots of variety" mantra espoused by nutritionists and featured prominently in the book.  If you live in a breadbasket (e.g. California), you can have a widely varied diet throughout the year.  If you live in a northern clime (e.g. northern Minnesota, most of Canada), you will not have access to locally grown fresh fruit and veggies for most of the year.  Eating as Dr. Schwarcz suggests would leave you with an enormous carbon footprint due to the transportation and refrigeration costs of moving the food from southern locations.It is also curious that Dr. Joe never mentions the placebo effect.  Some remedies are effective because the patient thinks they will be effective.  Sure, double-blind studies take this into account (people receiving the placebo and the test compound are both going to benefit from the placebo effect, so any additional effect in the test group will be due to the efficacy of the test compound), but anecdotal "evidence" is easy to accumulate by charletons, and these testamonials can certainly be true!  If you're one of the lucky ones whose cancer goes into remission at the same time as you started drinking three litres of acai juice a day, you will certainly "know" that the acai juice caused the remission.  So it's my unfortunate conclusion that Dr. Joe is singing to the choir with this book - those with a scientific/statistical background will be convinced, but we were convinced anyways.  Those who are the statistical outliers will still be convinced of their positions, and the charletans will continue to make money off of them.
4 "Phew! That was a lot to digest, wasn't it?"Those are the words author Joe Schwarcz uses at the conclusion of his book which is jam-packed with the latest data, debates, and drama about the foods (and chemicals &lt;gasp!> therein) we eat. His book is indeed a full-course meal...and then some.First, he leads us through a tour of naturally occurring substances in our food supply, including flax, fiber,  omega-3 fats, antioxidants, flavanols, vitamins, and minerals. Next, he presents the most controversial issues related to the manipulation of our food supply: fortifying with  iron and fluoride;  sweetening with natural and artificial sweeteners; manipulating genes in our food; and preserving with sulphites, viruses, and radiation. Then, he takes us up close and personal with the contaminants in our food supply, including pesticides, hormones, BPA, PCBs, and dioxins. And, finally, Joe leads us through the nutritional hype surrounding some of the latest nutritional fads such as goji juice, detoxing, DHEA, and green tea.It's likely your head will be spinning after consuming all the nutritional chemistry, controversy and and commentary that Joe serves up. (And, to answer his question above: yes, it is a lot to digest!) He does do an impressive job in guiding us through the maze of myths, misconceptions and truths about the foods we eat, but--as food science is rarely a conclusive one--be prepared to be confused at times.  Fortunately, Joe offers relief at the end of the book, to help us digest it all:"There is more to life than worrying about every morsel of food we put into our mouths. What matters is the overall diet...When you carefully scrutinize the scientific studies that are being rolled out almost on a daily basis, most amount to no more than tinkering with the basic nutritional principles we have tried to lay down: eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, and don't overeat."Whew.
2 In "An Apple a Day" the McGill University professor Joe Schwarcz offers salient useful nutritional advice.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  Meat is fine but make sure you have more whole grains on your plate.  Emphasize variety and balance in your diet.  Avoid processed foods, especially those high in fat, sugar, and salt.  Exercise.  There are no miracle foods and short cuts to a healthy diet.That's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355-page book.  I have many issues with the structure of the book, the main being Dr. Schwarcz's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there:  organic, genetically modified, detox, and so on.  It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis:  that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet.Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle.  There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement.  Quite the opposite:  eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.  Seeking balance, moderation, and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health.
5 Joe Schwarcz tells us what to eat and backs his advice up with the best and most verified lab results from all over the world. If you just love chemistry you'll love this book but if you care about yourself you'll find him a treasure chest of tips to live a long healthy time.
3 Most of us don't know what to eat anymore with all the marketing out there, this book touches on a lot of subjects, I suppose it would be hard to go in-depth and keep the book under 500 pages.  I enjoyed it, you can read it bit by bit and look for certain information or you can go cover to cover.  An easy read.  It doesn't answer all my questions but at this point, I don't think anything will :)Also - fast shipping and a great price.
2 Schwarcz is a Professor of Chemistry who has written several books about diet and nutrition. Judging by this book I'm thinking he should stick to chemistry.I'm not saying that Schwarcz's dietary recommendations are bad. After you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you've been hearing about for decades: Eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don't overeat. Hey, is there ANY nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?I majored in biology at college, so I thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. I was wrong. I can't really fault Schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. But the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about "the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat." Again I was wrong, and this time I can fault Schwarcz. Schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so I wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? He recommends that meat should be "an occasional treat," and even then the portion size "should cover a small portion of the plate." Those people who still believe in the "myth" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue Schwarcz's book than read it. Regarding other myths and misconceptions, Schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. I suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.I can't forgive the chapter on milk. His discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. He doesn't address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. He doesn't offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry's number one claim to fame. Schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. One study shows that "Asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than Westerners even though they consume less dairy." Schwarcz responds by saying, "True enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle." He leaves it at that, and he doesn't bother to say what parts of the "very different diet and lifestyle" are healthier! He then mentions the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study "which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures." Schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! I say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. To make things worse, Schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who "criticizes" milk consumption as part of the "antimilk lobby," driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. I eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and I'm not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean I must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? Schwarcz says that when we "look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium." Schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. But again, he doesn't offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. Furthermore, Schwarcz dismisses "antimilk" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. He's missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. Schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those Asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).This is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we're supposed to follow, as Publishers Weekly says, that "leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health."? I'd say it's a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. In the end, the best that Schwarcz can do is tell us that milk "is not a poison," as some fringe members of PETA might say.In conclusion, Schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations. You know the drill: Eat mostly veggies, fruits, beans, and whole grains, don't overeat, engage in enjoyable physical activities, get adequate rest. If you do all that don't worry about whatever else you like to eat!
2 I bought this book based on two 5 star customer reviews, and because at the time, it was 94th in books at amazon.ca. I've purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. This is the only one I sent back.Coming from a Canadian author, I was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled "Milk and Calcium", I lost a lot of respect for this man as a "nutrition authority".I think the author could have produced a better book, if he'd written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. Dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor is painfully obvious.He portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk's health benefits.Don't Drink Your Milk!: New Frightening Medical Facts About the World's Most Overrated Nutrient( While this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)He acknowledges that, "Milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!" He fails to acknowledge the theory that's becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow's milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health. That the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable pH level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body. He continues, "But milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture"."The anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning."( Again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. That in Nature, no other species would ever consume the "breast milk" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) "That's hardly a compelling argument. No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either."He tries to refute the Nurse's Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater risk for developing osteoporosis in general, and therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse's Health Study, as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough to overcome the other risks in this "self-selected subgroup". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.In this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a "trace of dioxin". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and also limit saturated fat in our diets elsewhere.He doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary type of milk proteins. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.Most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead, or deceive the public, by measuring "water" weight, rather than counting calories.This author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, "A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup."Of course he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.There is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their "natural" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.While some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production, and antibiotics to ward off sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions, much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to consume.The author claims that while "milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA".Webster's Dictionary defines poison as, "a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill".It's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is, as the Weston A. Price Foundation acknowledges, crap!While "milk and calcium" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility. Do I now trust or care what he says about fluoride added to tap water? No!Who do I trust?If you want to know what the medical literature says about diet and health, read Joel Fuhrman'sEat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss
2 Personally, I did not find the characters compelling and the plot seemed made for a movie.  Not what I am looking for in a book.
1 I am continually puzzled by the publishing industry's "prizes."  This book takes up an astonishing amount of shelf space in book stores.  Cover to cover there is nothing in it.  It is like reading a cut and paste book.  The characters are thin, flavorless, cliched, sleep-inducing.  The same with the dialogue.  I am still trying to determine what the author's purpose was, unless it was to bore us to tears (those would be the only tears shed).  I felt like it was written by an automaton, someone who does not care about the craft of writing but thinks she is precious.  There is no strength to the story or the sentences.  I actually felt insulted by this drivel.Read The Deptford Trilogy, by Robertson Davies.  Now there is a circus story you won't forget.
5 If I could rate higher it would be 10 stars. The author did her research. The characters in this book seem so real. You will laugh, you will cry, you will feel hatred. You will cheer. You will be moved.
5 I really cannot understand the bad reviews. This book is really good, the research amazing and the descriptions put you right THERE in the hobo camps, among the tracks, the dirt, poor workers and the wide broad differences between the performers and the grunts.I loved this book and the old mans' musings.. the ending was so awesome..I would give this 10 stars if i could..
3 A little book made for making a film, I felt. A bit shallow and predictable. Characters unbelievable somehow. Not challenging in anyway.
5 Every once in a while you find a book that just ticks all the boxes. I enjoyed every page of Water for Elephants and was sad when I finished. A lovely story for young, old and everyone in between.
5 This book was absolutely wonderful. Two chapters in, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite books I have ever read.. and it is. I could not put this book down! I definitely recommend it.
5 This book was a wonderful read throughout- I have loaned it to many friends since and everyone has enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this book to all types of readers as this story appeals to many.
5 This story is one of the most entertaining I have ever read! The author makes her characters come alive to the point where you feel they are family (the good ones anyway). I love the style of writing she uses, there is never a boring minute in this story about circus life. I would advise anyone who enjoys a story with animals and some very likable characters to get this book immediately! This is one entry that will never be deleted from my Kindle!!
5 I cannot begin to explain how much I have fallen in love with this novel.  I've never been so entertained, intrigued, horrified and ultimately satisfied by a book.  Each character had so much to offer to the story.  I slowed down as I neared the end knowing I had to say good-bye to Jacob, Marlena and Rosie (the smiling elephant!).  I will definitely go to the nearest bookstore and give Gruen's earlier novels a try.  This is by far the best book I have read in a long time.  I am recommending it to everyone I know!!
5 I don't typically buy books like this. I loved it. The story is unique and easy to become invested in. The characters are lovable from the very start. PLUS it's just a very coherent read which is a huge bonus for me. I really can't imagine who wouldn't like it.
5 Fast moving and gripping novel.  Historical details about circus life and live in general during the Great Depression are fascinating. You can't miss with this book.
5 The reviews were right, this was exceptional!!! What a truly eye-opening reveal of the way train circus life was for all those involved. I felt so many emotions all through the book and was certainly sad to have it end. A great 'read'!!!
4 This was the first ever book that i had read, when i first got my kindle. To put it simply it a good nice read. The story line is nice the characters are well developed and have strong qualities. Really theres nothing i could put in words what this book mad me feel. Thats what i look for in a good book. How the story makes me feel how the characters an i respond emotionally towards on an other. When i read i feel as i the story comes to life. And thats what i got out of this book the story came to life so freely and beautifully and th characters showed so muh emotian so much heart that what really made it special. So do yourself a favor and read this book
4 Having heard mixed reviews on this book I wasn't sure  what to think, but I found it to be an easy, enjoyable read. I recommend this to anyone looking for an easy before bed book or an accompaniment to your summer travels. Great fun!
5 I wasn't sure about this book after some of the reviews, etc. I guess the whole circus thing wasn't of interest to me, and so I put off buying this title for months. But last week, I gave in when it was listed at a phenomenal price. And I have to say, I loved it!It is by far the best thing I have read on my Kindle. Exciting, romantic, adventurous and slightly sorrowful at times. The characters were unforgettable. I adore Jacob at age 21 (and age 93) and he is a wonderful protagonist. This book is about circus life and the tragedy of a young man, but it is a love story as well. It is also filled with creatures great and small. So would I recommend this? Yes... because Water For Elephants is fabulous.
5 If you haven't read this book, you should definitely pick it up! It's definitely on the top 10 of my list! It is a must read for everyone. I loved how Jacob found an opportunity in the mist of his grieving over his parents' death.  He completely turned his life around for the better.  This book was not only a love story for me, but it was a book of adventure.  It had me sitting on the edge of my seat a few times during my read.  I like how the book takes you back to Jacob's past & present.  The ending of the book was completely unexpected for me.  I did not see it coming, but it's where Jacob belongs.  I think you will have just as much fun reading this as I did.  I couldn't put the book down!!
5 Jacob's life takes a drastic turn when his parents die. Stripped of everything he owns, everything familiar to him, all the comforts of his college and family life that he took for granted, he leaves his old life behind, jumps a train that turns out to be a circus train, and enters a totally new, different world. A circus is fun, right? Not behind the scenes, in this book. Jacob, a young adult, naive, still a virgin, unused to such a hard life on the road, confronts danger, murder, hatred, love, callous human viciousness, more danger, and finds friends and allies (not all of them human) in the unlikeliest of places.The story is told in turn, by the nonogenarian Jacob now in a nursing home, and at other times, by the twenty-something Jacob working at the circus and trying not to get killed -- mostly at the hands of his fellow-human-associates. Every chapter is an adventure, held my attention and took turns gladdening, saddening and surprising me.The circus animals also get into the act in this book and the author's sensitive rendering and treatment of them makes them all the more vivid, as "supporting actors",  Circus "employees", and fellow participants in the intrigue and action.A masterful ending -- leaving the reader with hope, glee and wonder. The very informative afterword by the author left me wanting to do my own research into this fascinating subject of the Circus.
5 What can I say? I'm not sure why I waited so long to finally read this book. From the prologue, this book held my attention. Gruen's writing style and attention to detail is simply amazing! At several points, I felt as though I was actually watching the show or walking beside Jacob while working in the menagerie. It felt real. And the perverse, morbid sense of humor she gives Jacob as an elderly gentleman is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Although, I must admit, I found myself fuming over the treatment of our senior citizens. That, however, is a rant for another time!The characters in this book are so rich and deep. It was hard not to form some sort of fondness for them. In addition, I found it amazing that Gruen was able to turn Rosie into a full character without completely humanizing her. Even though I have a strong bond to animals, I still felt a close connection to Rosie.From a lot of her terminology, knowledge of trains, animals, freaks, etc., I really think that Gruen did a lot of research before writing this book. It makes it a lot more authoritative and realistic. While the story itself is fiction, it makes it that much more believable and credible to be interspersed with fact.I will say that the happy ending, Jacob's extreme sensitivity, etc. might be seen as extremely campy. However, I felt that Gruen was trying to find something positive during the Depression. I feel that she did try to capture that, even though there was food a shelter, life on a train circus was not good either. The Depression was hard on everyone, and no one was left unaffected. So, while there was romanticizing occurring in the novel, it felt as though she was trying to make a fairytale in an unlikely setting. To me, that makes it even more endearing and tender. Many reviews I have read complain that she is trying to push an agenda with some of the issues she tackles, but, to me, this was just a romantic love story of two people finding each other against all odds. I do, however, have to laugh a little at the ending. That part might have been a bit over the top
2 I wanted to like this book; however, the reality was the writing was sub-par (it reminded me of a a middle or high school essay on what I did over the Summer) and the characters nor the plot were rich enough to hold my attention.
5 Much has already been said about this book, so I'll throw my five stars into the mix and keep it brief by saying this is an absolutely delightful story. I would definitely place it toward the top of my list of fictional tales I have thoroughly enjoyed.
5 This is really a fun read. The story is interesting, the writing flows easily, the characters are real and believable, and even though I thought a story about a circus during the depression era might be depressing, it was extremely interesting. I really enjoyed it and have placed it amongst my 'keepers.'
5 As always, the book was better than the movie. The movie was far too simple. The characters are actually very well developed in the book, with much better dialogue (that wasnt ruined by actors). Yes, I guess it's a romance novel, but not in a Nicholas Sparks kind of way. I think it's enjoyable for all audiences.
5 When I picked up Water for Elephants, I wasn't quite sure of the topic and was afraid I might have to put this book down - low and behold, it was a great book - very entertaining, the pages just kept turning and I finished the book wanting more!  The story of circus life is like none other, as is this book....
5 Just finished this book and I thought it was really good.  I thought the circus subject was interesting, along with some romance and I was really pleased.  For the last 25% of the book I was really gripping my kindle, waiting to see what was going to happen next!  This book did not disappoint!
4 It took me a bit to get into the book, but once I did... I could not put it down. The love story captivated me, and it is not really something you read about every day (the circus), which made it even more interesting.I would have given it 5 stars if I was more captivated when Jacob first joined the circus... even so, I definitely recommend this book!
5 Wow, where to begin. I literally just finished the novel, and was left with the most beautiful feeling of what it means to capture the essence of humanity. Yes! This is something you don't experience too often, and when you do you want to hold onto the feeling and never let go. I'm not going to give a plot summary, or play by play- that's what the product description and other reviews are for. This is a reaction review. I never really wanted to read this novel when it was all the rage. I would walk past it as I scanned the bookshelves, and ignore it on the best-seller list. However, when I saw the 3,000 reviews and all the positive stars mounting up, I knew people must be onto something. That coupled with my Kindle Fire Christmas present, and this is free in the Kindle Lender's Library.Where to start? From the moment you start reading, you are sucked right into Jacob's world, and the world of the circus. You find yourself running alongside Jacob, and taking part of the daily activities of the circus. The characters are highly developed, and you hate, love, and grow with each one of them. The author takes time to even develop the animals which I feel helps readers bond to the very world they now find themselves in. The story is never short of action, passion, compassion, suspense, and so much more-often at the same time. I found myself holding my breath for long durations of the novel anxiously awaiting what happens next.train In short, this novel is simply beautiful.
5 I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Water for Elephants been the only book all year where every one of my friends from book club gave a book such a glowing review.
5 I'm going to be careful here, because I don't want to spoil anything for potential readers.  Let me just say it is a great book, sometimes disturbing, but often funny and charming, or filled with action.  It also has a good bit of grit and tenacity in the main character.  It is a look inside a unique community that you wouldn't get a chance to view this close if you weren't being "escorted" by  one of their own.  You may be tempted to stop reading at some point if you are an excessively tender soul, however hang in there.  All you need to know for now is this, it is a fresh well-written book that you will love and ends in a good way so, have no fear of it and enjoy.
5 I am very interested in the time period of this story and setting. I am refreshed by their hard times, their often cruel lives and how they could even make it from day to day. There was one moment early in the book, I almost laid it down and didn't pick it up for it was so oppressive to me. I am an avid animal lover so I felt a double punch to the gut. Yes, I cried. Overall, it was a journey, through hard times...but you know what? They made it, and will continue.
5 This book provides an upbeat feeling and introduction to a lifestyle all its own during economic struggle. World.... welcome to the world of the traveling circus of times of yore. An easy read, very entertaining.
5 Enjoyed the way the story took place in different times. Loveable characters. Characters that were believable and true to life.
5 Had not yet watched the movie, but absolutely loved the book. A touching story, sometimes sad,  yet happy ending.Really conveyed the time period. I would highly recommend.
4 I found some of the "old-timey" phrases and circus lingo a bit difficult. I had to use the kindle dictionary as much as I could but most things weren't in there. I am still kind of confused about what "red lighted" really is. I need to Google that phrase. Anyway, beside the lingo I found a really interesting story. I never really think this about a book but I kind of wish this book were longer. I wanted to know more about the key relationship that the author creates. She really could do another book with material I think she left out, like what happens next.I recommend this book, especially if you are looking forward to the movie with Reese Witherspoon, Robert Pattinson, and Christopher Waltz.
4 I picked up this book because of the high reviews it had received and was pleasantly surprised. I finished it in three days having a hard time putting it down when it was time to make dinner or go to bed.
4 I didn't mean to inhale this in two days. It's the first book for a book club my two best friends in NYC and I are starting, and we gave ourselves a month to finish it. Two of us have completed it less than a week after it was assigned.The book tells the story of Jacob, now old, reminiscing about his life as part of a circus. It's an easy read, and no literary feat by any means, but it's a good read all the same. Its 300-plus pages fly by, and in them, you begin to feel like you're a part of the circus, understanding what it's like to work behind the scenes. It discusses the meaning of love, towards both humans and animals, and honour: what do you owe the people around you?The parts I loved best, though, and that touched me the most weren't the love story: I've seen too many of its kind before. No, it was the discussion of aging that got to me and made me cry so hard in the last two pages I woke my boyfriend up: what does it mean to age? What does your family owe you as you age? And what does your life mean when you're ninety-something, in a nursery home, and alone except for your memories? These questions terrify me: they wrack me with guilt and fear, and in raising them, this book became something more than a beach read. I don't think I'll think of Rosie too much, or Bobo; I don't think I'll remember Jacob or Marlena too often, either. But I will remember Jacob's struggles in the nursing home, and where we leave him when the book ends.
5 Since I've never written a review on Amazon, you can bet it would take one heck of a book to get me to do it. Water for Elephants is that book. I buy a LOT of books, and with most of them I'm left feeling dissatisfied. But with this book I read it over a weekend and just tore through it. Solid writing, thorough research, believable characters, and a great story. I just love this book! As a fan of HBO's Carnivale, it reminded me a lot of that series, but make no mistake, this is NOT a derivative work. I'm just hoping that Gruen will return to this universe in the near future and give us another installment.
5 I have not seen the movie and was not sure how I'd like a book about the circus but a lot of people recommended this novel and it got great reviews so I gave it a try. It was beautifully written with vivid imagery. How could you not fall in love with Jacob? How could you not be enterained with the stories about the circus? How could you not be enthralled with Marlena and Jacob's secret love? I really enjoyed reading it, in fact I could not put it down and it only took me a week to read it. I think this is a story anyone could enjoy, and the author did an amazing job with her research about everything from the circus to the prohibition. The parts about the old man got kind of depressing but there was a happy ending for all at the end. Highly recommended. Lovely read.
5 This is a fabulous story, written with humor, compassion and profound insight. We are first presented with Jacob Jankowski as an elderly man in a nursing home. The old coot may have problems with his short-term memory, but he certainly has a terrific long-term memory when it comes to remembering the details of his youthful days in a travelling circus. I thought that I had no interest whatsoever in the workings of a depression-era circus, including the care of the exotic animals and the various freaks and acts. However, the author depicts this unique microcosm of humanity with such passion and color that I found myself absolutely absorbed in the story early on.Adding to the historic ambience of this saga are the well-chosen photographs at the start of each chapter: a man with a deformed human growing from his stomach; a woman proudly showing off her bare upper extremities; excited people milling around the big top...It is the undercurrent of spiritual darkness that makes this story fly so high. Gruen depicts the battle between good and evil with stunning accuracy: the greed of Uncle Al; the brutality of August; the surprising kindness of the abandonned dwarf, Walter; and the meek vulnerability of Marlena and her animals.The scene with the drunkard Camel being told that he is dying of poisoning from Jamacai ginger extract is poignant. This, followed by scenes with Camel being cared for in a box car by Walter and Jacob. Stirring, because alternating chapters depict a now elderly Jacob in a similar position of helplessness.In sum, a GREAT book. Whoever thought that an elephant would carry such literary weight? (No pun intended.) I am totally baffled by some of the very negative critiques it has received on Amazon, only to be followed by 5 star praises. Some have said it is poorly written. Are we reading the same story?
4 I understand some of the criticism, but does a book have to be a literary masterpiece to be immensely enjoyable?  The overwhelming positive reviews explain why not.It is well researched, but maybe the plot stretched a bit too far at times and low quality dialogues have taken away from the book's otherwise star quality.The depression era was well represented, gave a good realistic feel of the troubled times and the people.  Circus setting was pure genius, and made it so interesting.Overall, it is a very enjoyable book, very readable.
5 Every once in a while, there's a book that seems written for you. It speaks to you in a way books you love haven't. You don't just visualize the author's words, they leap off the page, and rather than watching the movie in your mind, you are living it. You feel the pain, the joy, the laughter. When the book is finished, you're more than disappointed. You feel invigorated, and you search eagerly through the author's books to see what, along the same vein, she has to offer. You search readers' recommendations to find the books that leave the same imprint on you. Inevitably, though the books satiate your appetite, they don't resonate in the same way. Welcome to Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants.In the prologue, we're privy to a murder. We see it as Jacob sees it, and tries in vain to stop it. Though the victim and murderer aren't named, as we're introduced to them, it becomes clear in our mind who filled those roles.Then we start from the beginning, in the midst of the Great Depression. Jacob is in class, during the final few weeks at Cornell preparing for his finals before he becomes a doctor of veterinary medicine.In a moment, the Dean will enter and change his path. Jacob was to go home and set up shop with his father, working with the animals in his town. Instead, he goes home to identify the remains of his mother and father. He sees the sign his father added to their on-site practice: Jankowitz and Son Veterinary Practice. After identifying his family, he visits the lawyer, who tells him he has nothing. The bank owns the house and everything in it. The explanation as to why his parents mortgaged the house shatters him. He returns to school to finish his finals and finds that he can't.Jacob flees and seeing a train pass, tries to jump aboard. Once on, he realizes it is a circus train. An old man, Camel, vouches for him and works to get him a job within.As soon as the boss finds he is Ivy League educated, degree or no degree, he becomes the animal man. With such a prestigious job within, he straddles the division between the higher ups and performers, and the lower echelon who helped secure his place.One performer in particular, Marlena, fascinates him. She reminds him physically of the girl he left behind at school, and emotionally captivates him. She matches his love of animals. Married to August, who has the boss' ear, she is off-limits, but a friendship develops anyway.Later comes Rosie, an elephant pilfered from a circus that has gone defunct. Rosie suffers August's wrath many, many times. Jacob is stunned by her human like qualities. Understanding, pain, anger, empathy, happiness all emanate from her big brown eyes.Following the story, I felt all of the emotions Rosie feels (except perhaps, the pain). Astonishment at the goings on to keep the circus running smoothly. The love Jacob develops for many people who help him in the course of creating a new life for himself, free of the memories surrounding his past. Sadness at the loss of animals, anger at the treatment of the animals and the red lighting of, as they're called today, carnies.The characters came alive to me, as did the setting. As soon as I finished this book, I eagerly went to Sara Gruen's website to read excerpts of other novels she had written. While good, they didn't capture me the way this did. And I wanted more of this. So I went to Amazon's recommendations Disappointedly, I moved on to Barnes and Noble. No dice. So I tried the next best thing. Research. I wanted to read first hand accounts of the circus the way it was back then. The more I read, the more I craved.Then, as though they knew my hunger, work offered me discounted tickets to the circus. I'm still debating. On the one hand, it's the circus. Elephants that feel things like people do! Horses that synchronize! How can I say no? On the other hand, it's not the 1920s. It's almost 100 years later. What if it's not the same? I mean true, we're in the middle of a depression (point 4 of pros: It's almost the same!). But people are categorically different than they were then. Theoretically, this extends to performers as well right?But alas, I have chosen to forego the circus at this moment, because I fear, like the recommendations of Barnes and Noble and Amazon, it may fall short. So I will hold onto the satisfaction this book gave me, and the hunger for more of the same. Hopefully, there will be another book that catches my attention like this one. And soon.
5 A beautifully written, richly descriptive love story, and a wonderful testimony to the intelligence of animals. I haven't seen the movie, and I'm afraid I'll be disappointed.
5 One of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading!  I was so surprised at how well and clear it was written!  I loved every page.
5 I got WATER FOR ELEPHANTS as a gift from my husband. When I opened it I said to myself, why on earth did he buy me this? I aked him what prompted him to chose it - he said because I've had a life long fascination with Freak Shows and they're part of the Circus. OK. Fair enough.If it hadn't been for him buying it for me I would have missed out on what has become my favorite piece of fiction I have ever read.I am in love with this book.This book is enchanting. The characters are, variously, loveable, hateworthy, pathetic, nasty and dastardly.Sara Gruen knows her characters so well and writes them with such passion they seem real. You will feel that you know them too. And the writing is so vivid you will feel like you're standing ring-side. Inhale deeply - can you smell the cotton candy?And the ending of this book is the most perfect, satisfying ending I have ever, ever read.I'm not going to pigeon-hole it with category or genre and risk putting some people off...like me.There are some Book Club talking points at the end of the paperback version and one such talking point is to discuss the book's 'pathetic glamour.' That is a perfect descriptor. The circus fakes its glamour and its glitz; the daily lives of the crews who work it are anything but, and at times are brutal, harrowing, even.I've learned a valuable lesson from this book - what I want as a reader is just writing that takes my breath away. I got that from WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.
4 the movie almost mirrors the book but somehow the novel paints a better picture.  this is not just a &#34;chick&#34; book.
4 This is a well told, interesting story.  It  belongs in the historical fiction genre; the subject is the travelling circuses which tried to make a financial go of it during the Great Depression.  It is not a pretty picture, but as in much of historical fiction, it has a virtuous hero, and a very upbeat ending.  It also has an added dimension: the story is told by the hero as he resides in a nursing home, and suffers from the condescending  attitudes toward the patients there.  This aspect of the book was particularly good, and for me the most genuinely moving.  For that reason, I wish the author hadn't felt the need to give even this sub-plot such a "nice" ending.
5 I normally do not review books so that I don't spoil the read,l but I must say that this is a beautiful, touching, and emotional novel. Great!
5 What a story and what insight into the life of the hero.  From young man to old, he kept me turning pages.  It also caused me to assess my attitude of older citizens and my interaction with them.  And who doesn't love a circus.
5 A truly wonderful book! A good read for everyone. I highly recommend for all ages. You will not be disappointed!
5 I liked this book because it took me out of my normal modern day romance pieces to a place with such charm and drama and entertainment I just thoroughly enjoyed It.
5 I haven't seen the movie, but did see previews.  I though it looked like it could be good, but was raised where the book is always better than the movie.  I still haven't seen the movie, but I must say that this book is GREAT!  I debated buying it for weeks, and I am NOT disappointed at all that I did.  I honestly wish I would have bought it sooner!
5 So enjoyed the book, well researched, enticing story, pulls you in with romance and suspense. Excellent storyline, you fall in love with the characters and dont want to let go.
5 I have read many books lately and this is by far one of the top ten books that I have read!I never wanted to put it down. Exceptionally written and thoroughly developed! Not a disappointment throughout the entire 464 pages.This is a book that everyone should read!
4 Book DescriptionAs a young man, Jacob Jankowski was tossed by Fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety or ninety-three, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an un-trainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.[...]This book came to us as a recommended read from several sources. Once selected, we could not possibly put it down. The author, Sara Gruen, builds the detailed and fantastic world of a travelling circus during the Great Depression from the ground up! The story of Jacob Jankowski is one of sorrow, love and at times terrifying. His constant emotional struggles can be related to by many readers (though perhaps not as fantastical) and will captivate the imagination. The other characters Gruen constructed are perhaps the most remarkable outside of young Jacob, as with any circus, they all act their parts accordingly ... with flawless precision.One does not need to be a circus aficionado or historical reader to take pleasure in this novel, for it contains a little of everything to captivate any bookworm. We guarantee you will not be able to put this one down!
4 This is not really a particularly intellectual book, or the kind that will have you pondering but it will hold your interest and enthrall you; which makes it a perfect holiday read. It is not only a fantastic love story but is a seemingly accurate depiction of circus life during Great Depression (so you still get to learn things after all)and has enough plot to hold your interest but not so much as to seem over engineered. There is even a lesson about how we should treat old people.A good read
5 I finished all 350 pages in a day and a half. I Couldn't put it down. I've read a lot of great books, but this is by far my favorite of all time and it sooo deserves the five stars I gave it. It's like heartbreak, friendship, falling in love, fear, being forgotten, and a blast from a cruel yet exciting past all in one and I may go read it again once I finish this review. Water for Elephants broke my heart and touched me at the same time.
2 I heard from a few people that this is a good read...  Not true.  The idea of the story is interesting, but it is written like a bad television-remake set during the time period.  I did finish it, but I closed the book angry and disappointed.  That being said- I realize that I'm in the minority and I've spoken to other people who really enjoyed reading it.  Just isn't for me I suppose.
4 its a great book and i enjoyed it as a little slow in some parts but other than that i really enjoyed it
5 I loved the movie, but the book is so much better.The ending is so perfect! I wish it was longer!
4 Jacob Jankowski is a student at Cornell University, studying veterinary medicine so that he can join his father's practice.Near the end of his senior year and before he sits for his final exams, he is called into the dean's office and told his parents have been killed in an automobile accident. When he returns home to bury them, he learns that his father is bankrupt and all he inherits is debts. After the funeral he returns to Cornell where his room and board have been paid up until the end of the year. He tries to sit for his final exams but ends up leaving without answering a single question. He walks away from the college and finally jumps aboard a railroad car and begins what will be an unusual life, a hard life, and exciting life with a circus.The story is told by Jacob when he is an old man living in a rest home. It is a depiction of life during the hard years of the Great Depression, the even harder life as a member of a traveling circus, and also provides a peek into the life of early rest homes.I found the book to be a little raw in spots but also exciting and entertaining because I remember the traveling circuses with the big top tents and the intriguing side shows which, as a child, I was never allowed to see. Alma Winters-Author of the newly released Once Upon a Time Tales.
3 I was eager to read this book after all of the praise it has received. I wasn't necessarily disappointed but not exactly getting all the hype. I enjoyed the visual scenes that Gruen painted and could easily picture it. I just couldn't get past the story.  I didn't feel an immediate chemistry between Jacob and Marlena. I'm sorry if most other people disagree with me, but the 'heat' just wasn't truly there for me. At times I almost felt that Jacob only attracted Marlena due to his difference to August, not due to the actual love between them. While I also enjoyed the perspective of Jacob as an old man remembering his story, it really just left me sad whenever I read scenes from the older Jacob's perspective. He seemed so unhappy and it made me feel as if I were reading two stories, one with a happy ending and one with a sad ending. In all, I gave this story 3 stars because I felt that perhaps if it wasn't being sold as a love story I would have appreciated it more. Instead I am left wondering what was so noteworthy about the characters love beyond the fact that they supposedly found love while working on a circus.
5 Water for Elephants has a quality so many modern novels are lacking, and that is an sense of enchantment. So many novels these days take you to a place you would really rather not be, but even the scruffy world of the down-and-out traveling circus is full of mystery and--dare I say it--soul. Love doesn't hurt, either. My 84-year-old mother dislikes modern novels (too much bad language) but she loved this one.
3 There are books you read for the story, and books you read for the writing.  Water for Elephants is of the former variety.  It's a quick read and a good read, but it is not a great book.Ms. Gruen was thorough in her research, so the reader does get some feeling for the gritty world of the "train circus", yet I felt when I finished the book that I had no clear sense of who the characters were.  Jacob is a nebulous character as a young man, and a shallow one in old age.  As for the rest of the "cast", well, when they are good they are very very good, and when they are bad they are...monsters.  Rosie the elephant is one of the more developed characters!The author doesn't seem to have a good ear for speech, either.  Any of the book's dialog could come from any character's mouth, for the most part, and some of the things Jacob says (or says in his mind) as an old man seem to land with a clunk.  They just don't fit.Add to that a slightly corny ending and a structure that comes out of any pulp murder mystery (old person recalling a murder, then going back to the start of the story and working back up to the murder...with a twist), and you get just a middling-good book.I am vehemently against the use (abuse) of animals in circuses, so I was happy to see that animal abuse was part of this story.  In fact, I think the author cleaned it up a bit too much (few facts about the orangutan and the chimpanzee, for instance..it's sickening what the higher apes were subject to, and still are).  What I think she could have cut back on is the gratuitous details about sex and the cooch tent.  That all seemed tacked on and unnessesary.Overall, I consider this book worth reading, but I don't see what all the excitement is about.  If you really want a feeling for circus sideshow life, read the novel Geek Love.
5 It took a bit to get used to the flashback style of this book, but I very much enjoyed this story and all the characters.
4 Over all I did enjoy the book. It was a little hard to get into at first but the characters are great. The book triggers several different emotions and the last few chapters are addicting. It was very well written and quite enjoyable. Would recommend for 16+.
2 This book was a quick read and a creative idea. But it was dry. It could and should have been elaborated on. It seemed as though the author was bored with writing it. Granted there were times of strong emotion but for the most part it was just lacking in all aspects.
5 i loved it. im sad i waited so long to read it though and its the best book ive read this year
5 I am speechless.  This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  I literally could not put it down and was so sad when it ended.  This book brought out every emotion in me.  Loved it!!!
5 Skip the prologue and just start the story. Reading it won't hurt, but I felt a little tricked. And it was such a good story on its own. Love the old photos of the circus. Gruen did a great job with her research, I felt like I was there in a way that doesn't happen often.
5 This was a great book. It reads fast, and there are a lot of things going on simultaneously in this book which need to be thought about. I really enjoyed every word, and am going to check out her previous book next.
5 Wasn't sure I was excited about reading a book about the circus, but this was a great story with an easy storyline to follow.  My book club enjoyed it!
3 It was a good book, with parts that sort of jarred my sensibilities.  I enjoyed the story and the backdrop to it.  I learned more about early American Circus.  I also liked the elderly aspect to it as well.  I would not read it again, but I would discourage some one else reading it.  Once I started, I could not stop.
5 In addition to writing an engaging story that offers a glimpse into a fascinating world foreign to most of us, Ms. Gruen shows herself to be a master "architect" with this novel, crafting a story that flows seamlessly between two radically different eras in her protagonist's life. The book starts with a flashback, so you know at some point it's going to bring us back to the opening scene. But Ms. Gruen does so in such a surprising and unexpected way, with a twist that left my jaw on the floor. It's not an exaggeration to say I was stunned.With Riding Lessons and Flying Changes, Ms. Gruen proved she was capable of writing good commercial fiction.With Water For Elephants, she proves herself capable of writing a great American novel.
5 This is one of my all-time favorites.  The story is engrossing.  Rosie the elephant is an amusing and wonderful character. Loved her.
1 I got the Audible version of this book because I was curious about its incredible popularity and wanted to see what I was missing. Having finished, I'm mystified about the huge number of five-star reviews.I don't know much about circuses so I can't comment on the quality of the author's research efforts, although I see other reviewers have pointed out shortcomings. What jumps at me, however, are the one-dimensional characters and overly contrived nature of key plot points.It's never easy for an author to pull off a first-person narrative from the vantage point of the opposite gender, and I wish Sara Gruen hadn't tried to speak through a male character. It seemed fine in the parts where he was speaking as a 90-something, but the young-man version fell flat. Often during the romantic and erotic interludes I found myself thinking Jacob sounded way too feminine.August, the primary villain, was way too over-the-top: animal abuser, wife beater, paranoid schizophrenic (so labeled by August, the main boss), etc. Why is he even part of the circus. I think the author should have established some merits, enough to justify employing him. Of course August, the owner, is just as one-dimensionally rotten, so perhaps no merit was needed.I was also appalled at the self-centered irresponsible behavior on the part of Jacob, the so-called hero, who seemed quite willing to indulge his own "love" needs completely mindless of the horrific consequences likely to result for his friends. I don't want to go into detail which would force too many spoilers. Suffice it to say that I strongly believe that Jacob, the narrator and main character, absolutely positively does NOT deserve the long and largely happy life he'll eventually get to lead. It's one thing to care about animals and less fortunate humans. That test, Jacob passes with flying colors. But when it comes to moderating one's own urges and balancing them against the well-being of others (all others close to you, not just Marlena, the love interest), Jacob gets a huge F-.
1 I bought this book when it first came out, because of the exceptional reviews I read.  I have never finished this book.  I started it, shelved it, read three books, went back to it and I just could not foster up enough interest to continue reading.  The story line is uninteresting and the characters were dull. I finally accepted that I would not likely ever to read it; so I tried to sell the book back to the store. The book store did not accept it because this item was not moving from the shelves!  It was definitely not worth the money I spent on this item.
5 I just finished reading this book and I loved it! I put off reading this book for about a year because I thought it was about a circus and I'm not a fan of circuses because of the history of maltreatment of the animals within circuses. I thought it was about a circus but I was wrong, it was about much more than that. It was a wonderful read and I recommend to everyone.
5 Odd. Heartbreaking. Funny. Insightful. Thrilling. Shocking. Everything.Learn about circuses, nursing homes.What really got to me was when (how is incredible) the author got into the head and heart of a 90 year old man and bared his soul to us.Gotta go, I'm going to cry
5 This book is a quick read and a must for any summer reading list.  I read it while in a book group but devoured it and then went looking for more wishing that the story would go on.  A lovely story of a young man's life with the traveling circus amid the depression.  Having never read anything on the life of a circus traveler it was eye opening and riveting.
3 With the making of a Film based on this book and all of the rave reviews about it, I guess I had high expectations.  Don't get me wrong, I found most of it entertaining, but I think the story lacked in its development, and I never figured out why religion was ever even brought up among the characters in the earlier part of the book, when it apparently had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also a bit of a let-down because it was just too "happily ever after" for me.The funny thing is that I'm not a big fan of Circuses in general, but surprisingly, I found the source material to be rather fascinating,  So, if anything, this book will propel me to look into more historical reading material on Circuses from the 19th century to the turn of the 20th Century.
5 What an amazing book.  The story is engrossing, the main character is lovable and realistic and the story is fascinating.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.Bravo!  Amazing book. It made me smile and it made me cry.  I simply LOVED this book and will recommend it to all my friends.  Well written and wonderful characters.  Great read.
5 I've had this book for two years and only just read it last week.  Why did I wait so long???  This truely is a gem.  You feel like you know all the characters, and the ones you don't know so well are introduced with enough hints and inuendos that you can easily imagine their colorful pasts.  I fell in love with the elephant.  She brought a wonderfully odd twist to the story.And as for the author, I was half way through the book before I paid attention to the jacket picture and realised that it was a female. She wrote exactly as a man would tell the story.  The elderly Jacob was perfectly portrayed.  She has obviously been around very old people and knows how they act and react to all kinds of situations.I truely did not want the story to end.
5 and take a look at &#34;behind the scene&#34; of a &#34;train&#34; circus from a long ago era.  The book appears to be impeccably researched and the author has drawn on some stories that contribute to the books entertainment value and poignancy.Earlier reviewers have already provided a look into the plot so no need to reiterate.  I devoured the book in about three days and place it in the top 10 books read within the last year.  I found the characters, both human and animal, brought vividly to life and in a way that really made me care about them.  The ending might be a bit of a stretch for some but somehow so very appropriate.  Water for Elephants is definitely worth the time to read, imho.
5 Fabulous story. I read it before the movie. The book was way better. I loved that Gruen did significant research to make the story realistic. I appreciated all of her notes at the back of the book.Dream Weaver (Dream Weaver Novels) (Volume 1)
5 Great story line.  Who doesn't love the circus?  It was a great tale interweaving compelling and interesting characters, and flashing back from the experiences of a 90 (or 93) year old man and his younger self and his experiences with the circus of old.  Wonderful ending, but I won't spoil it!
5 I decided to read this book because of the movie coming out in April. Well, what a wonderful discovery! This book sucked me in from the first page. I could not put it down. I highly recommend reading this book if you are considering seeing the movie in April.
5 I didn't realize this was going to be a movie when I bought the book.  I'm almost dissapointed that the movie is coming out - they never live up to the books.  Narrator is an old man, and so funny. So much details in a circus I had no idea, and putting it in the 30's adds so much more to the story!  Enjoy.
5 I didn't see the movie. I wasn't interested in the story, but I somehow ended up with a copy and read it. I loved it! It was a wonderful surprise.
5 I found "Water for Elephants" extremely entertaining, despite never seeing a circus or having any interest in the subject.  The backdrop is the 1930's, and the book throws you into the era of carnivals, Prohibition, and the Great Depression.  You're led by slums with hobos, and everyone is dying for regular pay and something to eat.The story bounces back and forth between a man living out his twilight years in a nursing home, and his 23-year-old self... where circumstances find him joining a circus.  Life revolves around the train for these guys - they always travel in cramped space with all kinds of memorable characters.There are some great anecdotes so strange you'd think they were true.  My favorite was Rosie the bull elephant sneaking lemonade by pulling her stake out of the ground, and then being smart enough to replace it to avoid getting caught.The author respects the reader enough to let him figure out what's happening from contextual clues.  For instance, a show horse is put down, and the starving lions miraculously wind up fed.  You have to connect the dots to understand the whole story.Another positive: this book is not a tear-jerker and avoids supernatural components, unlike other popular fiction (e.g. Dean Koontz).  Note that there are some graphic sexual encounters and profanity that make this mature with a capital "M" - don't give it to anyone younger than a high school kid.
3 I hope the movie is more interesting then the book. It had its moments but if its price goes any higher on here I would recommend not bothering. It seemed a little generic.
5 I kept passing this book up because I just didn't think I would like it. Was I wrong. Loved it!!
5 I loved this book. Definitely a good love story based on trust and understanding of ones past. Have yet to watch the movie, and don't think I ever will.
4 I really enjoyed this book.  I had seen the movie first, and had great expectations for the book.the only negative thing i have about it was the terrible editing it was like it was hurried onto the kindle, or the software had a bug in it - lots of the letter "i" missing from the middle of words, every time the word "thanks" was written it was missing the "h" (tanks).  also lots of 1/2 and 1/4 in the middle of sentences for nothing, and sometimes numbers replaced letters or vice versa.Apart from navigating through annoying roadbumps of typos, the actual story itself is quite touching.there is also a lot of differences from the movie, but i can see where and why those changes were made to get it on the big screen.
3 IT'S BEEN TOO LONG AGO TO GIVE A REVIEW
4 It was suggested to me by a friend and available in the lenders library, I'm glad I took the time to read it (I did not see the movie).
5 Loved this book!
4 Love the details in this book and the emotions.  Could picture all the characters and their situations.  Liked the ending also.
3 Much dead space or predictable non-action could have been eliminated to make this a good short story.  Pace was much too slow.
5 The author painted a vivid picture of each character and moment of the book. The way the author portrayed the biggest moment of the book in at the very beginning became a shock at the end. Excellent read -- hard to put the book down.
4 This book has been on my to-read list for quite some time and I finally got around to reading it. I would have to agree with the majority of the reivews in that it certainly was an excellent and entertaining story. I am especially looking forward to seeing the movie now that recently came out.I liked how the story flipped from present-day Jacob who was 93 years old in a nursing home to the story of young Jacob on the circus train. The first part of the story of the events leading to how Jacob comes to join the circus in the first place really get the story going and draw the reader's interest. There is a fair amount of sexual content within the story that surprised me a little but was in keeping with the progression of the story. I didn't particularly enjoy the portrayals of animal abuse that happened on the circus train, but these also helped in building the storyline of August and Rosie (the elephant).I was pleased by how the story wrapped up and am definitely interested in checking out some of the other books by this author.
4 This story helped me in gaining a better understanding of what it is to be elderly.  The audio version is narrated by two men, both are meant to be the main character, one voice representing his twenties and the other is in his nineties.  It certainly isn't centered around being of an advanced age, but as a side story, it was still very clear.I was pleasantly surprised by my conflicted response to the story.  On the one hand, his lamentations over being at the end of his life made me sad; on the other hand, he was funny and his life was a full one, giving him many wonderful memories.My advice to a prospective listener or reader?  If you are bored with the first chapter, hang in there, it picks up and is worth getting to the end.
5 This was a very enjoyable book; while reading I thought "this would make a great movie"; I didn't realize until a week later that the movie comes out in April 2011. I usually download "free" books; I am so glad I paid for this one, it was worth it.
5 Twists and turns.  The book is based on actual historical facts blended with a great fictional story line.  It is full of believable characters.
5 Water for Elephants is a love story set in a post depression traveling circus and told from the memory of 93 year-old man.  The story jumps between the current life of the narrator a uncontented man who believes he is 90 or 93 and his rememberance of the love story between Jacob and the Benzini Brother's circus.After the death of both his parents Jacob a veterinairian student finds himself penniless. Although not intentionally  he runs away to the circus where he finds love.This story give great historical flavor and is a must read.
4 Water for Elephants is a tough one for me to review. I loved the theme and the split realities of it. You are basically following Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, through two of his life's biggest adventures. We are introduced to him at the circus and follow his story of how he becomes a vet for the Benzini Brother's traveling circus. We are also switching back into his current reality where he is re-living these days from the nursing home that he now resides in.There are good plot points throughout, and I did find myself wanting to get back to the book to see what happens next. At times, however, I found certain events did not play out in a way that was realistic to the story that was being built. Even though I was enjoying the story and the narrative - I found myself aware of the fact that there was an author behind it all, pulling the strings. Not being able to quite put my finger on why, I was often pulled out of believing the story, almost as if the author was showing too many fingerprints of the process of writing. For this reason - it was hard for me to get lost completely in the book itself.All of that aside, however, I still found it beautiful. There was a moment in particular when I felt incredibly sad for our main character - to the point where I had to put the book down and step away for a moment to collect myself. There is a wonderfully commentary woven throughout that allows the reader to ponder where one is at when you are looking back at your life in old age. I really enjoyed that thread.I had heard a lot of really good things about the book, and was going into it that way. Unfortunately, there was something missing for me when I completed it, almost as if I had skipped an important part. For that reason, I give it four stars.
4 Water for Elephants is a wonderful read.  The story grabs your interest quick and keeps you moving along at a great pace.  I enjoyed the way the author transitioned between the older Jacob and the younger Jacob so seamlessly.  Wonderful writing style.
4 Water for Elephants is first narrated by Jacob, a 90-93 year old living out his days in a nursing home. He begins to tell the story of his life including a 70 (or so) year old secret he's revealing to anyone for the first time. Jacob is a young man just short of taking his tests to become a Veterinarian until both his parents die, and his life seems to hold no direction. He accidently finds himself in the midst of circus train where he meets an unpredictable circus manager, August, his beautiful wife, Marlena, and later a difficult to train elephant, Rosie.The element that lights up this audio book is John Randolph Jones amazing narration as the tired and cantankerous older Jacob. His voice is heavy with age and experience. It would be difficult for any secondary narrator to compete but David LeDoux does a good job of holding his own. Though the setting is lively and obviously well researched, the love triangle is underdeveloped and the end of the book just sort of unravels. At turns mindless, salacious, and fun, Water for Elephants effectively captures a bygone time and offers some fascinating circus details most will enjoy.
4 Well researched but brutal in some parts, this depicts circus life as, I hope, it used to be.  Possibly not for your grandmother and definitely not for the feint of heart, this book tells it like was.
5 What a great storyline from beginning to end.  With such an amazing assortment of characters that feel like someone you know.  A great read.
5 I am not by any means a reader or fan of "Mainstream" novels. My tastes tend to lean decidedly toward the stranger side of fiction (Little, PKD, Laymon, etc). But I decided, while strolling the aisle of my local Amazon store, after reading review after review that all but bowed before this title, to try it. I am so glad I did.I tore through this book, not wanting to leave Jacob stranded too long. I just "couldn't put it down", I know how terribly cliche' that is, but it is the absolute truth.This novel made me smile, which normally is a turn off for me... what a nice change of pace. Pick this book up if you haven't already. Sit down with Jacob and listen to his story, you'll smile too.
2 This book was just so-so for me.  There was a total disconnect for me with any of the characters specifically between Jacob and Marlena.  I thought their love story lacked passion of any kind.  For me, it felt like the only thing keeping them together was the horses and later Rosie.  It wasn't until half way through the book when Jacob finally admits he's in love with her and it's so lackluster I didn't really believe it.  Perhaps I feel this way because I had just finished reading "Wurthering Heights" before this and expecting more passion between the young lovers; however I'm not interested in reading this book again to find out if that's true.......which is saying a lot.  I thought the most interesting part of the book was the Q&A portion at the end where Gruen talks about her research and how all the events that took place on and off the train were based on real events that happened to various circus's during that time.  Knowing that did kind of put those events into prospective, but not really being interested in circus history is where it failed to capture me.  In the end: Big on Circus history, lacking on the love story.  Not one I would recommend unless you like reading and/or learning about the traveling circus.
2 I was looking for a good read and after seeing the high marks this book received I thought I couldn't go wrong. I put it down halfway thru and only picked it back up because I paid for it. I read alot and I just don't get the extreme praise this book racked up.
5 A friend recommended this book and I was thoroughly engulfed in it from the beginning. Such raw, real life and survival during the depression era. Jacob is a wonderful main character who is thrust into a world, grieving and desolate after his parents sudden death leaves him with nothing. The story is told by him as an old man of 90 or 93 as he says and is truly blunt on how our elders are treated in nursing homes and devalued as human beings. But, the wonderful, painful and thrilling story of his life, his love and his journey after his parents death lands him in a circus is spellbinding.Just know that the ending will make you smile and cry and feel joy for Jacob!
5 Amazing characters. I'm still in shock over the fate of even the most disgusting characters in the book. Truly a masterpiece.
4 Chosen after reading an excerpt.  Good character descriptions. and scenes are beautifully depicted.  I felt involved in the story.  Bit of a surprise ending that leaves you wanting to stay with the main character a bit longer to see where he ends up.
5 Great book. Was hard to put down after you start reading. Wonderfully written. Seemed like you were actually there and you could see and hear the story as it unfolded
5 I bought this book orginally when it first came out. It has been sitting on my shelf untill this weekend. I started this book early morning and had it done by the end of the day. I couldn't put it down!I the author does a great job with switching back and forth between times. Alot of authors try and do this but can't acomplish it but this one did a great job.The book held me in suspense the entire time. There never was a down moment in the whole book. Something was alway going on to keep the readers attention. I loved that he did research to write this book. The pictures also helped with what you were imagining as you read it.The author does a good job with making us have a love hate relationship with many of the characters. One minute I wouldn't think someone was that bad and then the next thing they did I couldn't stand them or vice versa.The interaction with the animals brought in a whole different set of characters. Rosie seemed almost human to me.I hated and loved to finish this book. I haven't found something this good in a while.
4 I found this book easy to read and entertaining. I really enjoyed the present / memory back and forth set up.
5 I found this to be a wonderful book, full of memorable characters.  It was hard to put down.  The story shifts between the main character as an old man and his memories of  life with the  circus
5 I had heard a lot of positive comments on this book for a while and thought I would see for myself what all the praise was about.  Well this book deserves 5 stars and more.  It is really a book that will stay with you for a while.  I know it will be among my all time favorites, as well it should.  The writer has done an excellent job fleshing out the people and you almost feel as if you know them personally or have dealt with people like time in real life.  The depression was deep in the US when the story is introduced.  Life can hand out a lot of hard knocks, even to animals.  I really never thought about that aspect of life before. I am very happy I had the opportunity to read this book.  I delayed reading it many times because frankly the title put me off.  Then I remembered to never judge a book by it's title.
5 I had no idea this book was about the circus. I really enjoyed it. You know you've read a good book when you are sad that it's over.
5 I have a tendency of sticking with supernatural stories because I love the magic of them. While "Water for Elephants" is far from supernatural, this story was easily the definition of magical.The story actually starts out in the nursing home, which is so intricately described that I could hear the whirring of the mechanical machines; helping the patients stay alive, and I could smell the putrid scent of finality in the air. Instantly I was pulled in by the lyrical writing style. The author also does a nice job of analyzing life's major questions, and hopping on her train of thought was enjoyable.The unwinding of Jacob's memories is done so beautifully. Gruen achieved what few authors can and brought her characters to life. I almost felt like I was hearing this beautiful, heartbreaking, brave and wonderful story first hand, staring at Jacob's frail body beneath the fluorescent lights of the nursing home.This book took me on a journey, and at the end I wasn't quite ready to hop off the train. There was a twist I never saw coming, and my only regret is it took me so long to pick this one up and read it. I recommend it for people who love a story of adventure, bravery, and love that overcomes all obstacles.
5 I have read this book twice now, and every time it feels like I am discovering it all over again. Great writing and story telling.  It evokes all sorts of emotions at appropriate times, and in the end I felt completely satisfied.
5 I loved everything about this book: the characters, the settings, the pace, the story itself. I won't repeat the synopsis, as many others have done so, but this is one of those books that you still remember a few years later, with a smile. Don't pass it up! Another book not to be missed is The Help.
5 I loved the rich, descriptive language. The author does a great job of the writer's maxim "show, don't tell," revealing bits and pieces to fill in the details and background of characters over time. The main character, Jacob, is very funny, especially when he's a 93-year old with attitude. I felt so sorry for old Jacob after a while. I really wanted to get back to young Jacob and hoped for a happy ending. Without giving anything away, I was incensed at one point about what happened to old Jacob. I hated that part so much that I questioned all the favorable reviews. However, I must say that I'm satisfied with the ending and glad that I read the book. One bonus of the fact that it's a best seller: I was able to easily check this out from my local library after a few week's wait. No problem, I wasn't in a hurry.Regarding adult themes (beware potential SPOILERS below):I'm definitely NOT a fan of inserting graphic sex or nudity or swearing into a story for no reason. I prefer nice clean stories and think you really don't need to be explicit. However, I think the scenes in this story helped set the environment. They were typically treated with such humor that I laughed a lot and didn't mind them. First, young virgin Jacob guards a stripper while she performs. The striptease and gigantic breasts are described in vivid detail. Jacob's horror, amazement, and embarassment, having never seen a naked woman before shows he's really not in Kansas any more. That's the most explicit scene and it's really hilarious. There are a few other sexual situations, often mixed with drinking. The actual love making was left to the imagination. There's a little swearing. I found the beating of animals to be the most objectionable; Jacob, the animal lover, spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to help.
5 I loved the story and how the author merged the memories ofthe old man with his younger days.  I couldn't put it down!
5 I loved this book.  And to think it was the first from Sara Gruen at that. This is a book that spawned the movie of the same name.  I saw the movie first, then read the book, then saw the movie again. As often happens, the book provides much more color than the movie ever could. For instance, the owner of the circus, Big Al, is shown in the movie in only one scene for a moment giving approval for a purchase.  Sara researched the subject of &#34;train circuses&#34; in detail.  The cruel practices common during the depression to stay in business are shocking, but make riveting reading as the backdrop for this story of growing up, awakening, and goal-seeking.  Highly recommended.
5 I loved this book. I had seen the movie a while back and loved it. A friend of mine recommended the book and said it was much better than the movie. She was right. Gruen does a great job of developing the characters and you feel connected and part of the story.  I'm glad I finally read it.
5 I really enjoyed this book. Sarah Gruen did a great job of telling the story ofcircus with all the beauty, cruelty and the harsh life during the depression.The author states that she did research the circus during that time period and it shows in her writing.  She really describes the  people and animals that were the main part of a circus and they  come to life in my mind. I could see and hear them as I read the book.It starts off with the main character, Jacob Jankowski as a very angry oldman in a nursing home. He decides to go to the circus and reminisces about his past. We are then introduced to the young Jacob Jankowski. The book goes back and forth in time as many do today.The author really nails it when she writes about the depression. I have read and studied the depression and she portrayes it so vividly. I felt so sorry for the workers, performers and the animals. They all suffered in one way or another.The characters had their flaws.The book paints the Ringleader as a charming but violent man. One who had a short fuse and was a loose cannon.I was fascinated by Jacob Jankowski. In spite of the hardships that he had to endure,his kindness and gentleness never wavered.I admired Marlena as a beautiful, graceful and long-suffering woman. She was  not brave enough to leave. I recommend this book to all. The movie followed the book very closely except the Ringleader was not as mean as in the book.
4 The book its self was amazing let alone the characters. The characters, such as Jacob and Marlana, became a part of me, Walter and Camel too. I love this book and probably always will.
5 The character of Jacob going back and forth between past and present.  I fell in love with Rosie the elephant.  It was a hard to put down novel.  Highly doubt the movie can match the visuals created by the story itself!
5 This book grabs you from the minute you pick it up. It has intrigue, dysfunction, love, and amazing human-like emotions in the circus animals (from Rosie the elephant to Queenie the terrier).The movie was great, but the book had so much more depth and character-development.It seems so incredible that anything like this could happen in "real life", even during this period in US history. Tough circus life is described inamazing detail.The lopsided human love triangle adds another dimension to this book and its dysfunction. Would highly recommend this semi-fictional novel.
5 This book was everything I hoped it would be and more. A heart wrenching love tale set in the circus world in the great depression era. The characters capture your heart and hold it captive until the very last page.
5 This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I bought it for my Kindle, but it sat there for months as I wasn't in my "literary" phase.  I finally decided to give it a go, and was so incredibly surprised!  I LOVED this story!  It was filled with so many emotions and the characters are depicted in such a vivid fashion, I could picture them so clearly!  They stayed with me for quite some time after completing the book and that rates VERY high with me.  I even got my husband to read it and he loved it as well.  I really couldn't put it down until I knew just what happened to everyone....and the ending?  AMAZING!!!!  I cried in joy, fulfillment, closure and sadness!  Wonderful read!-Just My Opinion [...]
5 This is a book to escape into where you cheer for the good guy and hate the bad guy! A glimpse into another life.
4 This novel tells the story of a man who is now old and struggling with health problems. A carnival comes to town and he remembers the amazing life he once had. I loved the ending the most and hated when characters died. The story itself was believable and the characters complex. This book is not for children and can leave you quite depressed at certain points. Other than that [and that's more of an observation than a complaint] this is a solid read. If the characters didn't die this would've been a 5.
4 This story grabs you with swirly plots and colorful characters who live an extraordinary life style in the circus. Water for Elephants is for anyone who has a drop of gypsy in their blood or even just wishes they could live out their dreams of adventure.
5 This story takes place during the Great Depression.  It is a love story, but also a story about life with a traveling circus and all the rawness and crudeness that goes along with being part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth as remembered by Jacob Jankowski.  Normally, I'd much rather do my own reading, however David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones did an excellent job; the ninety-something-year-old Jacob was especially enjoyable.  When he read, I felt as if I were sitting next to him in the nursing home listening to his amazing story.
5 This was an excellent book! I always love the books more but the movie was just as good! Very well researched and written...definitely one of the top books!
5 Thought of my Dad more than once while reading this.  Highly recommend this read on a summer evening.  Thank you
5 Very thought-provoking and well-written. And the story told from two different time frames was very effective. It was also good to include interview(s) with the author telling about how she researched the story, too.
5 Water for Elephants was a great book! Loved the transition from young Jacob to old Jacob, the parallels between the circus and the circus that was the nursing home. I could have done without some of the language but all in all the book had me hooked from the beginning. I recommend this book for anyone interested and unsure. It will not disappoint.
5 How a book about a 90 year old man can be so interesting and entertaining I don't know but this book is both.  I will recommend this book to anyone.  The story is an old man in a nursing home recalling his life in the circus.... a GREAT read.  The story has heart, action, suspense, tenderness...a real page turner.
4 I got this with my free trial month of prime....I really liked the book.  As usual the book is much better then the movie.
2 This book is not what I expected at all.....I guess I expected more of a love story as well as an adventure and what I got was neither. While I give the author credit for her obvious research on the era...the story was so incredibly slow!!! I kept thinking "is this over yet??"  I wanted to like it I really did. Definitely a disappointment. I wish I thought differently.
5 Wow!  I picked this up to read on the airplane to & from Las Vegas.  I wound up finishing it while on my trip.Gruen is a wonderful story teller, you can tell she researched extensively for this novel.  While it's not a book really about a circus, that is the main setting for most of the book.  I really thought it would be a book all about Carnie Folk.  How far from the truth was I?!The story is told from the view of an ageing circus vet, which is different to begin with.  One would think that these types of stories would be told from performer's points of view & while that would be interesting, Jacob's POV is just as intriguing as another other's would have been.It's a great short read that's captivating & spellbinding.
4 First I must mention that I love books that take you to a time and place that you have no knowledge about and in this case it's circus life in the first half of the 1900's. It was fascinating to read what life was like in those days for those who worked in the circus, from performers to the labors. As for the book itself I did enjoy it, but I wouldn't call it a page turner and often in the first quarter of the book I thought about just putting the book down and starting something else a little more exciting to read. However the farther into the book I got the more I started to care about the characters the more invested in the book I became. In the end I was very glad I continued to read the book and now I can say I would recommend the book to friends.
5 I can't say I have ever read a book that was even remotely similar in plot or storyline. Water for Elephants is one of the most original novels that has ever graced my eyes. I felt all the emotions Jacob did as I read, and the story seemed to transition seamlessly between the present, and his memories without being confusing as some other books can be when they try the memory flashback thing. It's one of the few books that I read that I simply could not put down, stopping only to eat and sleep.
5 This is a very beautiful, well-written story that at times had you really feeling - both good and bad feelings - for many of the characters. Jacob lived a hard life after his parents died but I appreciated his tenacity. He was determined to make it in the circus and to make it in life. I throughly enjoyed the ending and I think if I was Jacob that that's how I'd want to spend the rest of my days too. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a story about real life, struggles, love, loss, and hope.
5 ...so all I can do is add my voice to chorus.Gruen writes an incredible dual-novel.  The tale of one man, both fresh out of college and fresh into a nursing home.  The character development is impeccable, with every player on the stage being exposed to the reader to the precise level needed for their role.  As for the plot...this is such a fresh story, I had no idea where it might be going.  This was the first book in a long time I hadn't figured out ahead of time.If you enjoy fiction, read this book.  Possibly the best written novel I've read in years.
5 Very interesting history of circus life.  Could not put this book down.  Wonderful story filled with flashbacks of circus people and environment.
1 got the sample for my kindle and loved it.  bought it.  then it got raunchy.  alot of bad language and vulgar descriptions.  I just wish all that had been in the sample so I wouldn't have wasted my money buying the book!
5 This unique story brings back a slice of the 1930s, the long gone circus world of the past, but not the usual bigtop action.  The main character is without giving away anything serves in a position that straddles the worlds of performer and worker and yet belongs to neither. There's madness, grinding poverty, tradgedy, revengeexcitement, bewilderment, surprises, and revelations, but I don't believe a review should be a book report, so trust me if you like suspense, tinged with the meaning of life itself, please do yourself the favor of reading this wonderful novel.  I wish I could erase my memories and do so afresh.  Jim.
5 This novel made me want to meet someone who had worked on a circus before.  The prologue is all I read in the store and I immediately felt the need to buy it because of the mystery.  The book is filled with exciting storylines that will capture your attention and keep it there throughout the story--hoping that the storyline will end as you hoped.When you get to the part in the book that the prologue mentions, the actual outcome will surprise you. The animals all find a way into your heart and the characters are all worth remembering and holding on to.  I recomend this book for anyone interested in historical fiction or even science fiction because while it revolves around reality, a cirus, the way that it is written almost feels like science fiction.
5 I don't read fiction.  A snob journalist, I believe my time is better spent reading non-fiction. Due to reasons I won't bore you with, I picked this book up and thumbed through the first couple of pages, just to see if the writing was any good. I didn't put it down. Read it through to the finish. (The last time this happened with me and fiction was fifteen years ago with "Boy's Life" by Robert McCammon.)Sara is a wonderful storyteller with an engaging narrative style, and Jacob is a colorful character with whom to build a story around.So, if you're a non-fiction snob like me or a fiction addict like my wife, you can't go wrong with this book. Highly recommended.
4 Really enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down.  Some parts a bit disturbing.. but good.
4 The story line is simple, man meets girl, falls in love and must get past all obsticles in the way of their love BUT I loved the descriptions of all the characters, time and events. ie.traveling circus. I do not think the idea was so original.ie boy meets girl, ect. but the research that the author put into the circus idea was just great. I actually felt like I learned something about a life I would never had even thought to learn anything about. I would definatley look for more titles from this author because her research and time put into her characters and themes is fantastic.
3 I am an avid reader, and ALWAYS like a book better than the movie based on it.  This time, that was not the case.  It was just okay, but had I not seen the movie I probably would have loved it.
1 The concept of this book was interesting to me but this book is boring. The characters are one dimensional and the main character is lame. I decided not to finish it after reading other reviews that say it is a waste of time (I got about half way through).
4 The perspective from a 90 or 93 year old (he can't remember which) man in a wheelchair in a nursing home, with flashbacks of his life on a circus train during the Depression all provided an interesting, thought-provoking story.  In addition, the conversation with the author and the study questions at the end of the book are a nice bonus.
5 This bumped Secret Life of Bees off the top of the my list for audiobooks. I LOVED this book and highly recommend it as an audiobook. It's like a one man play.
2 I had high hopes for this book.  Lots of great reviews, an interesting setting I find fascinating, and a love story--not too shabby.  I didn't go in expecting literary greatness, but even so this book fell flat.  For starters, the "old man reflecting from a retirement home" is a tired technique and all those chapters bored me to tears. My main problem with the novel, however, is that the characters are one dimensional.  They always seem to be doing dramatic things and facing tragedy after tragedy, but I couldn't connect because there is very little reflection or internal monologue (not even in the retirement home!).  The story clips along at such a quick pace it gets bogged down by its own far-fetched events.  I found it difficult to understand why the characters, and even Rosie the elephant, act the way they do--everything seems trumped up to make the plot work. I can't say I even completely understand the title.  I got the connection to the man in the retirement home who claimed he carried water for elephants, but what in the heck did this have to do with the story?  Maybe I'm just not deep enough to understand!  Quite frankly, I didn't enjoy the book much at all and my advice would be to skip it.  Perhaps the movie is better.
4 I was extremely happy with every aspect of this book until, in one of the final chapters, when Uncle Al tells Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic, or as he puts it, a "paragon schizophonic".  After reading this, there seemed to me to be simply too many similarities with an older novel I read in 2006, William Styron's modern classic SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  A beautiful Catholic woman and a handsome Jewish man who fight a lot due to the man's schizophrenia, another younger man who is new to their 'group' who has feelings for the woman...sex...death...the only dfference seems to be the circus setting and the fact that in this, the woman DOESN'T die and ends up married to the new, younger man.  A nice book, but not extremely original, at least not in the romantic storyline.
5 This is my new favorite book. Besides being a GREAT story, I feel like I have made many new and interesting friends.  Sara Gruen demonstrates a gift for characterization.  Each character transcends his/her strengths and weaknesses to portray the good, the bad and the ugly of circus life in the post-depression era.  She truly captured the mystique of "running away to join the circus" through her characterization.Jacob Jankowski's (the narrator & featured characher) sense of humor is priceless.  I found myself either chuckling out loud or squirming in disgust throughout his storytelling.I found the book difficult to put down; yet, I did not want it to end.If you don't read another book this summer, read this one.  You will experience a myriad of emotions--happiness, sadness, fury, longing, relief, distress, even enchantment. . .
5 Not a book I would have picked to read, but it was selected for my bookclub.  Have to say I loved it, it reminded me of one of my favorite novels, Angle of Repose by Wallace Stegner, in it's effective use of flashbacks. The story is different and engrossing, showing a subculture rarely seen.  I didn't expect to like a book about the circus, but found it fascinating.
3 I had a hard time getting through the book, so I gave up and just watched the movie.  I enjoyed the movie although it was so sad.
5 I purchased this book as a gift for my daughter, which she loved She gave me a great review, therefore I can recommend the book to you.
5 I couldn't put this book down - an excellent story, easy read and fun! Now I can't wait to see the movie!!
5 What took me so long to discover this book?  I hadn't heard about it from anyone, just found it during a "browse."  I've been looking for a good read for so long and "Water for Elephants" was right there the whole time.  I can't wait to read Sara Gruen's other books and when I finish them, her new one should be available.  She brings to life the good, the bad and the ugly of the circus world and her characters are vivid and full of life.  I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and falling in love with the main animals.  I couldn't wait to get to the next page...and the end was worth the whole trip.  For me it was one of those books that I was sorry to finish.  Thank you, Sara Gruen, for the beautiful journey.
5 Was an excellent read would not have chosen on my own but book club picked it & I enjoyed it .Would recommend it as a read to anyone.
5 First of all, Sara Gruen tells a really good story. People and animals both have their moments. What most impresses me though is her ability to show the feelings and memories of an old man. Once old, we tend to forget that the old man in a nursing home was once a part of exciting and dangerous events.To me, the viewpoint and dialogue of Joseph at 90 (or 93) really makes this book.Give it a read.And now the point of the Audio review:  If you like the book then you will find the unabridged audio a real treat. The reader captures the characters and takes you right along. We have listened to the story twice and still appreciate the skill of the reader and the beauty of this book.
5 This is the best book I have read in a long time!  A great love story and a trip back in time to the 1930's, in the viewpoint of an elderly man.  An interesting look at circus life.  Also, I am not a member of PETA or anything, but I know many die hard animal lovers would appreciate this book also.
5 The reality came from his voice when he was 90 and when he was 20. Absolutely enjoyable. The early circus, as it came to town was truly captured. Brought back old memories.
5 Where to begin? A real page turner. I can't tell you how much housework i neglected to read this wonderful book. if you dont read anything else, you'll be fine with this one!
5 I started reading "Water for Elephants" on a Saturday night and before I knew it, I had read half the book in one sitting. Sara Gruen's protagonist Jacob Jankowski, carries you through the novel - both as a twenty-three year old who just walked out of his Vet exams and onto the Circus arena and as ninety-three year old man stuck in a nursing home. Gruen's flawless ability to capture Jacob's voice both as a young and old man are is one of the many strengths of her talents. The storyline, which is composed of coming-of-age, love and well a circus will draw you in and keep you till you eyes read over every last word. "Water for Elephants" is a brilliantly, well-written and engrossing story that will appease to both men and women alike.
4 I thought this book was an interesting and quick read.  The story pretty much grabs you instantly and I finished the book within a couple days.  I'm always in the market for a good love story and this book was fast paced and interesting.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm looking forward to it.  I love Reese Witherspoon.  I would recommend this book!
5 I loved this book! I found it very easy to read and get lost in the story. I liked how it was told from present-day Jacob's view looking back on his life. This helped me understand what type of man he was. I felt like I was there will him throughout this story. The setting of the Great Depression made the struggles and triumphs mean so much more. I found all the main characters; Jacob, August, Marlena, Walter, and even the elephant, Rosie, to be extremely poignant, especially when you remember the story is told from an elderly Jacob. The transitions from "memories" to "current day" Jacob were very smooth and I didn't feel distracted or lost during these changes. If you love a romance novel with hero and heroine, then you must read this book!
5 1) I hate the circus because I don't believe in subjecting animals to this kind of treatment.2) I loved this book so much it is now one of my favorites because:3) After reading this book, it's made me understand so much more about the inner workings of the circus and that for every villain associated with mishandling animals, there is a hero or two protecting and nurturing these creatures.I applaud the author, who is a horse breeder/activist from what I gather, for writing about the circus. I thought it was going to be some horrible account of the circus life and have no substance. Boy was I wrong. The protagonist Jacob leaves his exams to become a vet after learning of the death of his parents and literally jumps aboard a train not knowing what kind of train it is or the kind of people on it. I guess you have to just take the biggest risks in life sometimes and do what does not make sense to reap the biggest rewards.I am anxiously awaiting the movie to come out in April! I hope they don't butcher it.
2 I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, but I found myself skimming through parts in the middle.  Not sure if I understand all the fuss.
5 This was one of those books that caught my attention from the very start and had me continually wanting more. I can't tell you how sad I was to have finished this book so quickly! What an amazing read!!!
5 No matter what your taste in books may be this title has something for everyone.  Fantastic writing!!
5 I bought this book before i watched the movie and of course the book was WAY better than the movie. it is written beautifully and you instantly fall in love with the characters and feel their emotions.
5 I LOVED this story!!!  What an amazing story-teller Ms. Gruen is.  I couldn't put this book down and absolutely loved every minute of reading this wonderful tale.My wish...Please make a movie out of this delightful book!!!
5 I absolutely loved this book! I enjoyed the history, the animals and of course Jacob and Marlena. I'm an animal lover and was heartbroken the way some were treated in the book, but, you must realize this can be reality. Trust me justice is served for the animal cruelty. I plan to pull this book out next year and re-read! It's a keeper.
4 When I downloaded this book, I honestly didn't expect much more than a nice way to pass some time.  I really underestimate this little gem.  Once I picked it up I found it hard to put down.  In fact, I stayed up past my bedtime to finish it, but it was worth the extra cup of coffee I had to have the next morning.Without going into any details about the story itself (there's more than enough other reveiws to do that), I'll start by saying I was almost immediately endeared with the main charachters, which is a testament to the writing abilities of the author.  I laughed and cried with the characters, and was genuinely sad to see some of them go.While the ending was more than a little predictable, it was still a good read.
5 What can I say, this book moved me. I saw the movie and put off reading the book, the movie wasn't bad but didn't inspire me to start reading.  Wow, am I glad I did! The transitions from depression time to the present left me breathless. The expertly told story played with all my emotions.  Left me with a renewed appreciation for the difficult times my parents and grandparents grew up in, yet made me want to experience them.  I couldn't put the book down until finished then I went to my computer, looked up old circus pictures and finally bought tickets to Ringling Brothers Circus later this summer.
5 I used to love to read, however it has been ages since a book has captured me like this one did. The description of characters is both dear and terrible at times.  The description of the life with the circus in this time in history is fascinating. Not really for young readers, it is a bit lusty in some areas but not offensive to me. I have not experienced the movie yet, it will be a challenge to capture the quality of this  book.  I look forward to reading more of Sara Gruen novels.
5 This is an "Indiana Jones" action packed novel. Some things predictable, some things not. Great descriptions and an emotional attachment.
3 I agree with many of this book's reviews.  They're right; the author does make you empathize with her characters.  When reading, I felt like I was right with the characters, watching them.  Many reviewers also emphasize and appreciate the book's unusual story.  The story really does have wonderful historical flavor.  Most of the characters participate in a 1930s traveling circus, and reading about this circus-society is entertaining and informative.Now, for all of that, the book's writing was nothing extraordinary.  While Sara Gruen tells a unique story, she is not a unique storyteller.  Her writing was too common for me, too similar to the writing styles of so many authors who are currently alive.As I was reading, I kept asking myself, "Have I read anything by this author before?"  The truth was, I had never read anything else by her.  But I felt like I had, because her writing style and word choices were nothing new to me.I imagine that, in a couple years, I won't be able to remember reading this book.  Perhaps I'll hear someone talk about it, and I'll get a feeling of deja-vu and say, "Oh yeah.  I think I might have read something like that, at some point."Again, don't get me wrong; this was an engaging book.  It was entertaining, and I cared about the characters.  It was a good read, and well worth my time.  I happily recommend it to people who want to be entertained, and who might like to read about the circus.  Just don't expect anything amazing.Oh, and if you don't like violence or scenes with sexual content, you should probably stay away.  I don't mind these things - this doesn't affect my rating - but I figured a warning was warranted.
5 I passed over this book many times but one day decided to take a chance. I was not expecting such a great read. Read the entire book in a day and was left wanting more. Such as, did they ever find Walter's and Camel's body after the train stopped? Did they ever capture or prosecute Blackie and his gang for murder? Wish I knew more. Maybe there will be a second book later. Meantime, for those of you not steeped in elitist review criticism, this book is a wonderful surprise.
5 Jacob Jankowski loses everything dear to him; he goes a little nuts and joins the circus. Gruen writes an engaging story that kept me turning the pages. She knows how to build suspense; she uses foreshadowing in the first few pages that makes the reader want to get to that point in the story. Although this may sound commercial, it's a complement: this novel was made to be turned into a movie, and I believe it is going to be one. Join the circus and fall in love!
5 This is simply just a wonderful book!The characters are well defined, each and everyone of them!  You care, you like, you love, you hate!The story unfolds with Jacob, at 91 or 93...he is not sure, and his life.Schooled in vetinary science, he finds himself adrift after the loss of his parents and any financial stability.  He joins the circus and meets a cast of characterS like no other.His love for Marlena, his ultimate choices and growth...the paths taken...andThen...he is 91 or 93...just read it...I can't wait to see the movie...it will be magic!
5 A wonderful story about a wonderful warm gentle human being through his words you see his life past and present  excellent book.
5 Well written. I couldn't put this book down! A tragedy turned almost comical, back to tragic, resulting in excitement, laughter, and never ending love. I recommend reading the Q&A; after finishing the book - they are interesting.&#34;I said what I meant and I meant what I said. An elephants faithful one-hundred per cent.&#34; Dr. Suess' Horton Hears a WhoI appreciate the fact this quote was used in the beginning of this book. The ties it makes to the story line are perfect.
5 I haven't seen the movie (I wanted to read the book first). I loved this story line. Very entertaining and such a fanastic ending. I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see how the movie compares.
5 I must say that Water for Elephants was a great read.  A heartwarming story, I can relate to the story line of the nursing home, I work in one, and it put some laughter into the book. This was recommended to me by my Sister's friend.  I am glad to have purchased this one.  Sara Gruen did one excellent job.  Thank you Sara
3 I was so excited about this book. Something about it really made me want to love it. I bought the hardcover, which is something I never do, because I didn't want to wait for the paperback edition. I should have saved my money.The story was interesting enough and it certainly kept me engaged for the entirety of the novel. I would have liked the detail to be more fleshed out. Some parts seemed to be rushed (like the ending) while others were oddly long. I also think it was easy to tell that it was a woman attempting to write from a male perspective and while sometimes that works out fine this time something seemed a bit off.Still the book was fine and everything came full circle. The ending was neat and tidy, but really not a bit realistic. If you are looking for a quick read this would fit the bill, but it's not a book I'm keeping around and I certainly wouldn't read it again.
4 Water for Elephants has it all- adventure, drama, romance, history, and the circus! What more can you ask? Seriously, read this book.
5 After debating whether or not I wanted to read this..it came up as a free book for prime members..so I thought what the heck. I absolutely loved it, even with the prices of violence here and there. It was a great story, with a happy ending
5 Very well written.  A fascinating story about the circus folks of the 1930's.  This book will make you laugh and cry.
2 The story follows Jacob Jankowski, who is living out the rest of his life in a rest home.  When he was 23, he was poised to become a veterinarian.  However, fate stepped in and he left school.  He ended up joining a traveling circus, where he assisted with the menagerie.  During this time, he falls in love with Marlena, who is a performer in the show and also married to the ringleader.I will say that Gruen is gifted in her ability to create imagery.  You can see the animals and feel the angst that the circus employees go through under their sadistic leaders.  That being said, I can't say that Marlena is a well-developed character.  I don't feel as though we know why Jacob fell in love with her, beyond the fact that she was beautiful and cared about her animals.  It feels as though that part of the story was left out.And why is August, Marlena's husband, so evil? It does sound as though he suffers from some mental issues, but what is the background on him?I just couldn't fall in love with these characters nor the story.
2 Thankfully I read this for free from the Kindle Prime lending library - I would not have wanted to actually spend money on this book.The beginning of the story with the older Jacob reminiscing was initially interesting but from there on, the story went downhill for me.For one thing, I couldn't shake off a distinct impression of deja vu as I read this book. Then it struck me that I was strongly remindedof Stephen King's "The Green Mile" when I read the old Jacob sections (very old man in an old person's home reminiscing about anoddly sentient animal while struggling to retain his identity in the face of unsympathetic caregivers). There's even the Popeye/Olive Oyl8-pager which is also referenced in "The Green Mile".  The Jacob/Marlena/August triangle was similar to the onein William Styron's "Sophie's Choice" (volatile charming Jewish man with a personality  disorder married to a younger sensitive woman, theyoung man taken under the older man's wing falling in love with the wife, resulting in violence and upheaval).But beyond that, the Jacob/Marlena love story was very poorly developed. Marlena never came together as a three-dimensionalcharacter.  When older Jacob talks about his wife and how she was his helpmeet at the beginning of the book, a weak, passive character such as Marlena was not the woman I pictured. I certainly don't understand why he fell so deeply in love with her. The ending was feel-good but nevertheless unsatisfying due to its lack of realism.The few plus points in this book are the quirky secondary characters such as Walter and Camel. The thematic setting of a traveling circus was also interesting but after reading the author interview included with the Kindle version, it seems a lot of the side plots and atmospheric color were lifted largely unaltered from actual instances the author read or heard about while researching the book.Given the hype, I didn't expect a book that I will barely remember in another month except for its similarity to other, better works.
4 Thoroughly entertaining. I really enjoyed this book, from beginning to end. From the first chapter I loved how the author transitioned from present day and back. I learned about traveling circuses and now I want to know even more!
4 One of the most entertaining piece fiction I've read in the past 12 months. During post-depression era, the protagonist, Jacob, is left penniless after his parents' sudden death. Completely aimless, he jumps the first train he sees and literally lands in a circus train, plunging him head-first into a fascinating world filled with performers of all shapes and talents, a miserly ring-master, a beautiful horse trainer and a liquor-drinking/Polish-tongued elephant named Rosie.Sara Gruen does an incredible job of incorporating history and urban legends: paralysis that afflicted thousands from drinking "Jake", an alcohol substitute concocted during The Prohibition; the humongous dead hippo that was preserved in formaldehyde to fool thousands of viewers (pickled elephant).I highly recommend this book; just sit back and let yourself get lost in this strange and fascinating story.
5 This was a great book-had a hard time putting it down at night.Now to see if the movie is half as good!!
3 I enjoyed this book but I hate to say it, I enjoyed the movie more.  The story is lovely, an old man reminiscing of his days in the traveling circus.  Somehow, the story just tells better visually.  I found the use of present tense in the book just doesn't work.  I felt bored in parts where the author used unnecessary details during action sequences.  Overall, it's an original idea so kudos to the author for that!
5 I wasn't sure about getting this book, but once I started reading itI didn't want it to stop.  It was heart-wrenching in many ways.  I wasso sorry that the family failed to see past the old man's age, butthe ending made up for it all!
5 This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  I loved the characters and the talent of the author to intertwine them with the story line.  I could not put the book down and hated when it ended.  I have not seen the movie yet, and am not sure I want to since I enjoyed the book so much.  I would highly recommend it.
5 Loved this book-kinda kept you on your toes,going from Old to young but was totally enthralling and somewhat historical... what a rough kind of life to have lived. Want to see the movie but glad I read the book first. Yeah for Kindle-I haven't read a book in YEARS.
4 This was a tremendously fun and interesting read... not to mention educational too. The whole travelling circus/sideshow thing has always fascinated me, so it was interesting to find a novel with that as it's backdrop. The characters felt very real and I found myself reading far past my bedtime because I wanted to see what was going to happen next.The only dissapointing part of the book to me was at the very end. I can see how some people like things to be tied up in a nice little bow, but to me it was so implausable that it almost ruined the whole reading experience.
5 What a ride ! Well written with exquisite detail.  The characters are as rich and colorful as the romance of the circus itself. What child has not dreamed of running away to join the circus?  I couldn't put this book down until the last page read. This story has everything, romance, villians, murder, mystery, friendship, compassion....oh yes, and an elephant. Wonderful, wonderful end. Thank you Ms. Gruen.
5 This is not just a good summer read. It's a good (no, make that excellent) all-season read. I won't go into the plot because other reviewers have done it, and done it well. Suffice it to say, this book had me in its clutches from beginning to end, and the story has stayed with me ever since that last page was turned. In addition to Rosie (the most endearing elephant this side of Horton and Dumbo), Gruen's circus characters grab hold of you and refuse to let go. I was particularly enamored of Kinko/Walter and the way his relationship with Jacob developed over the course of this compelling story.The writing is rich and fulfilling, full of texture. This novel will engage all your senses. You will see the big top and hear the guys pounding in the stakes. You will smell the animals, the aroma of fresh sawdust and breakfast cooking. And you will feel the same pleasure and pain the characters feel as they take your hand and lead you into the world of a Depression era circus.As for how Gruen, a young woman, managed to get herself into the head of a 93-year-old man? Well, isn't that what superbly talented authors do? Transport you to places you never thought you'd ever go?I'll be looking forward, eagerly, to her next novel.
5 Jacob Jankowski is an old man now - either 90 or 93 years old - but his youthful memories of life as a veterinarian with the Benzini Bros Most Spectacular Show on Earth remain vivid, especially when a traveling circus camps just outside the grounds of his assisted living care facility. All those he cared about during his circus days: Marlena the bare-back rider, Rosie the elephant, Camel the roustabout, Walter the dwarf and Bobo the orangutan are dead now, but they glow with life in Jacob's memory.  It's true his memories are not always pleasant. His years with the circus were depression years for the country, with circuses failing on all sides. If you read this book you'll see a side of the circus you probably never imagined: its rigid caste system of performers vs working men, skipped paychecks, long days and longer nights, jealousy, madness and death. But you'll also find beauty, love and great kindness, especially to some remarkable animals.Oh, and the ending is quite wonderful if perhaps a bit fanciful. A grand book about the big top. Don't miss it.
5 I loved Water for Elephants.  I have always been interested in circus folk, and their lives behind the scenes.  This story follows a young vet's life working with the circus during the depression years. The great depression also interests me, so the book fit me to a tee!
3 I have to agree with a lot of the mediocre and low star reviews. As many have said, it is a very interesting subject, but it could have been done much better.  I'll preface this by saying that I hardly ever read contemporary fiction, so perhaps I'm just not used to the modern style of writing.  Most fiction I read is from the era when a book could not be published if there was too much "obscenity" or if it was too graphic.Nonetheless, here's where I felt this novel fell short:As others have noted, it felt too contemporary.  Some of the language didn't seem to fit the times. I know the "f" word and other swearing has been around forever, but I almost never hear people from that generation use it. Also, young Jake laments being a virgin so much, but from talking with people who came of age before the sexual revolution, it was pretty much expected that one would remain that way until marriage. Even Hugh Hefner was a virgin until his mid 20s.The character of Jake was not convincing. I didn't get a good sense of who he really was as a young man, and the young Jake and the old Jake could have been two different people as far as I could tell.I didn't find the old Jake to be very symphathetic.  I felt bad for him for being trapped in a nursing home, but he gave the nurses a hard time and picked fights with another male resident which canceled out a lot of sympathy I would have had for him.  Also, I had trouble with Jake's situation.  If he couldn't even remember his family members who came to visit or the names of the nurses who took care of him, how come he could always remember the names and details of his fellow residents with no problem?A lot of reviewers had trouble reading the scenes about animal cruelty. I love animals, but I didn't have that much trouble reading them because I wasn't really convinced by the writing.As many others have said, the ending is unrealistic. Some people may not be bothered by this, but that's one thing that irks me.On the positive side, it was entertaining. It captured my interest and I was curious to see how it ended.
1 I dislike strange sexual behavior but most of all I hate killing and mistreatment of animals and other humans.  I just didn't look into the book far enough to realize these things were written about.
4 Definitely a good read, I got through it in a weekend, but I wouldn't read it again (glad I read it once though).  To be fair, a book has to be REALLY good to get a 5 from me.
3 I am so tired of first person narratives, so maybe my complaint about his book isn't objective. All the "I, I, I, I," really got on my nerves. The movie was so much better because I didn't have to read the word, "I" anymore. The book also contains a lot of offensive language, which didn't seem to fit the era. The story line was interesting and moved along at a nice pace.
5 I have a soft spot for elephants and had compassion for this big one.  Plus it is a wonderful, well written love story with lots of action of the emotional kind.  Great book
5 This story line captivated me from the first chapter.  It had ALOT of swearing and graphic sexual content which I didn't enjoy having to wade through and skip over.  I didn't think it added anything to the storyline, and felt that it could have been left out all together.I found the author commentaries at the end to be most fascinating.  It was interesting to read that the story line has some non-fiction events weaved into it.  I you don't mind filthy language and sexual content this is a great read.
5 Nothing about this book appealed to me.  Not the subject matter, nor the title, nor the cover.  Pfttt.....nothing. A depression-era traveling circus?  What could be more....depressing?  My sister delivered into my hands one day and said, "Read it."  And I did.  I read it while cooking. I read it while eating.  I read it when I should have been sleeping.  I read and read and wanted to read more.  Now I hand it to you and say, "Read it".  You won't be sorry.
5 I really enjoyed this book. While reading it, I felt the author either had experience with a circus did a great job researching the material. The old man telling his life story caught my imagination right away and I couldn't put it down. Loved the detail and the story line. I felt I was back in history.
5 Jacob Jankowski is 93 years old.  He is as sharp as a tack and somewhat cantankerous, as many of us will probably be if we live so long.  At 93 he resides in a nursing home, not his choice, but probably for the best.  Now the circus has come to town and set-up within view of the home causing great excitement.Jacob was a member of the traveling Benzini Brothers Circus during the Great Depression and his memories of those days are still clear.  Water for Elephants tells the story of how Jacob lost everything while finishing his final year at Cornell Veterinary School and joined the traveling circus.Gruen tells the story in two parts, going back and forth from the past to the present time in a way that is easy to read and very entertaining.  Her extensive research into traveling circuses and elephants makes this a very good readThis is one of those books that once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down.  It has been on the NY Times Best Seller List for 76 weeks as of today and it is still ranks in Amazon's Top 100 after nearly two years since its publication.  If you enjoy this book, you might also likeThe Sweet By and By: A Novel, by Todd Johnson.
3 I expected more substance, but it's not there.  Still, reasonably well written and easily read--like (or with) a light pinot grigio.
5 This is an immersive, addictive, intricately researched novel that transports the reader to dusty, hardscrabble depression-era US. Young Jacob Jankowski flees his veterinarian final exams at Cornell when he learns of his parents' accidental death. Faced with sudden poverty when the bank takes his parents' possessions, he starts walking with no destination in mind, and jumps a circus train in the middle of the night. The inner world of the circus unfolds around him as he learns of the class divide between the workers and performers, the fragility of the circus' desperate illusions, and the economic vulnerability of everyone on the show. He becomes the show's vet and befriends monkeys, tigers, horses, and one oppressed but ultimately triumphant elephant.Sara Gruen is a master of plot, building to a suspenseful climax and weaving together her storylines with tidbits and gems from her research on American circuses. She respectfully explores her characters' strengths and weaknesses, ultimately delivering an honest and intricate portrait of a difficult time in US history. This book was a 100% satisfying read.
5 Great book.  bought this for my kindle and started it but am so busy I barely have time to read for pleasure.  great book
5 This is the first book in a long time that I feel lives up to it's hype.  Never read this author before but that is about to change.  I "feel" Jacob both as a young man and the man in the nursing home.  Being of an age that usually is in a nursing home, this is a great insight into them and I hope everyone who reads it will feel what I am feeling.
5 I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a great story.  An interesting glance into the old circus life during the hay day for circuses.
5 This is a must read for any circus lover. If you have a thing for elephants, this is your book.
5 I loved this book.  An intriguing peek behind the scenes of a (fictional) circus in the early 20th century.  I thoroughly enjoyed it - well-paced, GREAT characters, and an interesting plot.  I highly recommend it!
5 this book was recomeneded to me by a relative.  we have an age gap and she is old enough to be my grandma.  we both loved the book it is a good read for all adult ages.
5 Water for Elephants was a great book - it had me flipping the pages whenever I had a spare moment.  I would highly recommend this entertaining book!
5 What a wonderful adventure!  I read this book in 2 days.  From the first page I was charmed.  The scenes played out so vividly in my head.  I am thinking that in my old age (someday), I will think I was really there!  Just fabulous!!
5 it's been a very long time that I do this, see a movie AND buy the book!..that's how much I just loved this story & I know the book is better.The movie is good, I think Reese was miscast for some "visceral" feeling of mine!That part is so "meaty" and I don't know who but she did not fill the shoes for me..Patterson was incredible and the production incredibleCheers..Tony(NYC)
5 Loved this story!  I did read the book before I saw the movie.  The movie was well done, but of course the book has so many more details!  Read this book!
5 Sara Gruen has penned a most enjoyable book about life in the circus.  The story unfolds in two time frames from the first-person point of view of Jacob Jankowski.  As a twenty-three year old vet traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth and as a ninety-three year old man confined to an assisted living facility and repulsed by the sight of his aging body, his ever-sharp mind moves us effortlessly between the two time periods.  We are told he is about to reveal a secret he has kept hidden for seventy years----and what a story it is!In 1931, a tragic accident takes his parents from him and leaves him alone and penniless in the midst of the Great Depression.  The circus is both his salvation and his personal hell as he signs on to care for the animals.  Jacob and the characters he encounters are drawn so vividly that you will remember them long after the last page is read:  Marlena, the pink-sequined star of the equestrian act; her mercurial husband August who suffers with bouts of paranoid schizophrenia; Walter, the dwarf whose mother sold him to the circus, and Camel, the first member of the circus to befriend Jacob will all make you laugh and cry and cry again.  But it is Rosie, the lemonade-stealing elephant, who will steal a piece of your heart and cause you never to look at elephants in quite the same way again.Heartbreaking, poignant, and with a double surprise of an ending, this amazing plot unfolds with actual circus stories the author tells us in her end note that she has taken from real life.  Peppered with antique photos of long-ago circuses, this is an amazing book not only of circus life but of a man coming to grips with his diminished capacity and the aging flesh surrounding his ever-young heart.  A true joy for this reader, and one I highly recommend.
5 I enjoyed this book so much it nearly read itself.  Skillfully weaves in a mystery as well as some hard truths about bumming the rails during the depression. Does for the circus what Daniel Mannix's Memoirs of a Sword Swallower did for carnivals.
5 Others have reviewed the store line much more in depth and better than I can here. I loved this book. Once I started reading it, I didn't put it down. This is not a silly little beach read as it has been touted. It is more in depth than that.The characters were believable. They didn't do anything that was totally out of character once their basic personality was developed. The setting was realistic and interesting and a vital part of the story. The ending was surprising.Very well written. Very interesting. Worth the time to read and worth the money.Enjoy.
2 Just didn't like the story.  I don't think I even finished the book. Just not my kind of story. .
5 I enjoyed reading Water For Elephants very much. There is excitement, love, sadness, and fills you full of empathy while reading. You begin to feel as though you are a worker on the carnival train going from town to town following the drama and excitement. One of the best books I have read.
3 I liked this story and I think others will, too.  It has a good plot and interesting characters.  I just don't consider it is one of the best books I've ever read.
5 It has been a while since I read this, but remember it as a great story with action, love and experience in this occupation.
5 Probably was one of the last I know to read this but was well worth the wait...sickened me how they treated the  animals, seemed like a realistic look into the circus life. sad but satisfying read.
5 Loved the book, the setting reminded me of the HBO series Carnivale. Read the book in one day because I could not put it down.
5 Water for Elephants is truly an excellent read. The story is narrated by Jacob Jankowski, well the 93 year old version and the 23 year old version. The young Jankowski joined a traveling circus in depression-era America after the sudden death of his parents. With his veterinary background, Jacob is put in charge of the filthy, underfed and sometimes abused animals. The Benzini Bros. traveling circus is everything one would imagine a circus to be-dirty, crazy, and full of all kinds of different folks. Workers are apt to disappear in the night (thrown from the train, no longer able to be paid). It is obvious that Gruen did her homework on traveling circuses. Her terminology is spot-on and her vivid description is exquisite. The stand out characters are August the animal trainer, Marlena (his wife and a performer in the circus), and of course Rosie, the elephant. Gruen weaves together a story that is at times hilarious, heartwrenching, touching, warm, sad and so moving. The ending is perfect, and I could not have asked for a more enjoyable read.
3 Maybe I'm missing the bandwagon (no pun intended), but all these reviews that say "amazing", "best book I've ever read", etc.??  I don't get that.  I was drawn to the story and the characters, and it was well-written.  It was an easy read, so I finished it in a day and a half.  However, I don't consider it anything more than a fun read--something good for the beach or the plane. I'm defintely not seeing the hype.
3 An interesting way to showcase circus history & a way of life that is no more.Although this is a fictionalized account, it was based on bits & pieces of fact from Circus History.The photographs were the best.They were a nice addition to the book.The nursing home drama/tie-in was a bit too much.I guess it was a play on the theme of running away to join the circus...Just never heard of someone who ran away from a nursing home in a wheel chair to join the circus & was successful with it!
5 Water for Elephants presents a story of a veterinarian's life told from both his present and earlier life perspective.  The way that the author switched between time periods was entertaining.  I found myself experiencing a wide range of emotions from horror to curiosity to anger and then to happiness.  I personally have never been to a circus so I don't have any memories of my own to go by.  However, the author's descriptions of the circus atmosphere and "class" system within the different groups makes it very easy to imagine just how life was living on that train traveling from town to town.  I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to the film version.
4 This is a book that you can read again and again and its like meeting old friends. The plot lines are well woven, the characters are easily invested in and the ending satisfying.
5 A great read!  Warm and wonderful storytelling. Character, color, and story: it's all here!Author of PUSH NOT THE RIVER Push Not the River and AGAINST A CRIMSON SKY Against a Crimson Sky: A Novel
5 This book is so delightful.  I cared about the characters right away - Sara Gruen knows how to portray people well.  The story was compelling and the world of circus people so different from the one the rest of us live in, it was fascinating.
5 Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants is one of those rare novels that will be read and re-read, discussed and enjoyed for many years, by old and young alike. Destined to be passed among family and friends and back again, until the tattered, timeworn pages resemble the books beloved central character and narrator.Jacob Jankowski had studied Veterinary Medicine and was days from exams when his parents were killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, he hopped a train, never intending to "run away with the circus".... It was the midst of the depression and life was hard. Joining the Benzini Brothers Circus would change his life again. From town to town, day after day, set it up, tear it down-the freaks and geeks, midgets and clowns worked, ate, lived and often died together. The harsh conditions are made even more unbearable by the greedy manager and his insane animal trainer. Yet somehow, in the midst of despair, friendships and laughter persevered. Although much of the laughter was alcohol induced, during the height of the depression and prohibition, you took what you could get.The narrator's transition from the young circus vet, to the elderly, cantankerous nursing home resident, is a well-crafted, bi-lateral view that pulls the reader into this fictional world and never lets go. Whether in his twenties, admiring the beautiful equestrian performer, Marlena, and caring for the animals he loved-or in his nineties, complaining about the indignities of old age, the warm, quick wit comes through loud and clear. From the big top to the nursing facility Gruen's sharp, three-dimensional, fictionally fluid characters will have you laughing out loud one minute, mouth agape in disgust the next.Hurry, hurry, step right up, readers and book lovers everywhere. If you hunger for a reading experience chock full of every conceivable emotion, beautifully written and wholly engrossing, Water for Elephants is a wondrous world, where fact and fiction combine, delivering the most memorable and pleasurable hours, you will be spend with a book. Characters so sharply drawn and wrought with emotion that there nearly flow off the page.Armchair Interviews says: If you only read one book this summer, let this be it!
3 I enjoyed this book but did not feel it quite lived up to the high ratings I based my purchase on. Part of its appeal was the promise of a circus story. And the story was very realistic in some ways, detailing how difficult and unrewarding (not to mention very dangerous)that life could be.Some of the most interesting and moving parts of the book were actually those that took place in the nursing home that Jacob now lives in, remembering his youth with the circus. The author did a great job in describing the sadness, loneliness and other problems that befall the very aged. Especially those nearly forgotten by their families. Their cold treatment at the hands of people who barely see these elderly souls as human is all too real, having witnessed this myself when working in this type of facility. And another reason why I got out of nursing.The love story was so-so, and years were wrapped up too quickly, at least for my taste. I looked forward to more stories of Jacob as the circus veterinarian. There was alot of potential there for interesting and moving stories about the animals, but that aspect was barely touched upon. Rather it was more about Jacob's obsession with the beautiful Marlena.I loved many of the interesting characters, but always felt I did not quite know them in spite of their frequent appearances throughout the story. Walter the dwarf as an example. He was one of my favorite characters. I found myself wanting more of his own story, but it wasn't there.I would recommend this as a light summer read, but would not look for more than an interesting diversion and brief look into the world of the circus folk when the animals were still transported by train and when the circus coming to town was the biggest news of the month.
4 The story was thoughtful and well-written.  The present-day Jacob was actually more compelling and believable than the Jacob of the main, remembered story.If you liked the circus world information, and have a high tolerance for some graphic content, read Gary Jennings' "Spangle" (which has been split into three separate books for paper back), a rich, detailed story of a circus in post-Civil War America and Europe.Spangle
3 Didn't love this one as much as the other reviewers.  Some good moments with dialogue and plot but that I just didn't find myself enthralled by the story. It was a little slow at times. Kept putting it down and picking it up. Just all right.
4 I saw all the great reviews so I gave Water for Elephants a try.I really enjoyed this book.  Masterful story line and clever characters.It was a fast read.  I can hardly wait to see the movie!
5 Wow, I loved this sorry of the 1920's circus life...I also loved how it related to a person's life in a nursing home.  The surprise ending was just right for me, as I like to be uplifted and happy with the ending.  this writer is fabulous and I will want to read more of her work!
5 I will never forget when I read this, I could not put it down and it stayed with me for days. It is fantastic story with fantastic characters. Sara Gruen has created something magical.If you enjoy Water for Elephants I also recommend The Night Circus by Erin Morganstern.
5 I really enjoyed this book. It was slow to get into but with all these great reviews I pressed on. It was worth it. Read it!!!!!!!
5 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I likes how the author would go from present date to the past. I thought the plot was very exciting and interesting. From the title of it, I would have never have guessed what this book was really about. I would definitely recommend this boom to everyone. It was an easy read and I think many would enjoy it too.
3 I looked at the reviews before purchasing this book - I thought I would love it. As it turned out, I had a hard time getting into the book. Once I finished it, I watched the movie to tie in the parts that I didn't get. It was not horrible, just not my taste.
5 I absolutely loved this book; it will definitely be a re-read.  I read this book before I saw the movie but knowing which actor was playing what character, I could definitely create a mental image of them and it definitely made the story that much better.  If you're one of those who likes to see a movie before reading the book (or just seeing the movie) that will work just fine but I'd still recommend reading the book.
5 This book is a grotesque fairytale. It's both charming and disturbing, and it will stay with you for a long time after you put it down.
4 This book is a good read. Long chapters but puts you right in the circus with Jacob and Marlena and Rosie.
1 I really wish publishers would rate books like they do movies.  I got to the porn part and once again threw another book in the trash unfinished.  Problem is these books are good and the authors don't need to put the trashy parts in - they choose to.  Garbage in - Garbage out.  Guard your heart and your mind don't buy this book. Buy something else or wait for the PG version.
3 It was mentioned in the public radio and on the New York Times list--- means should be readable. I guess, for regular folks who only dream of running away and joining the circus, it was entertaining and everything but was annoyng when narrative style sort of goes back and forth in between Frank McCourt to James Frey.( I am. I do. I think. I feel. I, I, I.... )I don't know, I am less than half of Jacob's age but have been lived and worked in the circus, I just couldn't feel or smell sawdust in it at all. I couldn't see any character's face clearly. As author notes in the end, it is a patchwork of cut and pasted information from her research. I wish the author did bother to travel with the show, any show, awhile. Then she would have understand that big top and cookhouse ready to serve hot meals won't go up in length of just 5 paragraphs even with all the machineries of millennia, let alone of 1930s.There should be generations of elephants handlers to be found in Sarasota and their stories are worth listening to than museum facts, that is if you can get in to their doorsteps and able to decode their language.I understand this book is a fantasy. If you want to smell sawdust, try based on true historic circus figures "The Final Confession of Mabel Stark" " Modoc: The True Story of the Greatest Elephant Ever Lived" or watch "Dumbo" in retro circus.In the category of fiction, even though it caused lot of pain to people all the characters are based too obviously, I'd give "Roustabout" some credit because its author was actually there, though not on the tent crew as the heroine.Congratulations anyway, how about donating profit and future movie deal $ to circus vet. funds( for humans and animals) ?
2 In a time of difficulties and in a place where exotic things are a rule, Sara Gruen sets her novel "Water for elephants". The story starts with moment of violence and from then on is tolerable narrative mess. The main character is a veterinarian student who drops school, joins a circus during the Depression-era, finds love, hate and whatever may crosses his way.The lessons he learns are so valuable that decades later, living in a home for old people, he can still perfectly recall them - and pass them along. He is Jacob, a strange figure, who is no longer an alien when he runs into people even stranger than him. Tod Browning's movie "Freaks" comes to mind, but Gruen never reaches the same level.The only redeeming point in the book are the old black and white circuses pictures with scenes from a bygone era. On the other hand, Gruen's heavy-handed prose lacks the sparkling that would enhance "Water for elephants". Her storytelling abilities are more focused in the tell - when it should be the showing - missing the chance of creating a whimsical story. We learn every step Jacob takes from a to c, even the unnecessary b. With card-board flat characters, the aninals end up stealing the show. These excesses tone down the narrative and keep the novel from reaching a higher artistic level.
5 This book was very moving for me.  The way Gruen writes about the older character seemed so very well done.  Even though I am not old, I felt older reading those passages.  Gruen moves back and forth from present day to the past very smoothly and it is always a seamless transition for the reader.  Great story, good characters, loved Rosie the elephant. Very thought provoking and I really adored the old carny photographs sprinkled throughout the book.  Never thought I would enjoy a depression era book, but this one was really well done.
5 I avoided this book for a while due mainly to the over-hype by various celebrity talk show hosts. In the end , however, it is worth all the acclaim. Excellent reading, wonderful book.
5 The book was an excellent read.  It was very well written and gave you a good picture of life in the circus in the l930's.
3 The imagery of the circus was incredible.  The story of the ninety year old version of Jacob was compelling and touching but I found the actual story of the younger Jacob J. lacking depth and development.  Overall it was an ok read and I'm glad I read the book.
4 Ninety-three year old Jacob Jankowski, now living in a nursing home, reminisces about the summer of 1931 which he spent with the Benzini Brothers circus.  The inner workings, relationships, conflicts of circus life are so well described in this novel with such interesting detail, you really feel like you are there.  Following the events of Jacob's life made me laugh and cry.  I really loved this book and am looking forward to seeing the soon-to-be-released movie.
4 I would give it a 3 star up till the last 3 or 4 chapters. It ends good and that's why I gave it 4 stars. I like a book that you cant put down. But I didn't get that with this book! But it's cute
4 As a child in Memphis, Tn., the  most exciting time in my childhood life was when the days the circus came to town. My father loaded me, my two brothers and my sister into the car and off we went to the Clyde Beatty circus under the big top. Water for Elephants brought these memories back as though they were yesterday. I read the book over a 3 day period and really enjoyed it. It's a terrific story that I would recommend to all my friends.
3 i just got done reading this and i was enjoying it till about half way thru.  then it became immensely boring to me and i kdpt reading only to say that i finished it.  i really don't think it had much of a plot and i feel the ending was kind of just "wrapped up" quickly.  it started out very hopeful, but in the end, not one of my favorite reads.
3 I liked the book although a bit depressing and if you are an animal lover some of the references to how the animals in the circus are treated can make you a bit uncomfortable.  What I didn't like was the ending - it ended quickly and on this high note that seemed forced (don't want to spoil anything for anyone but I was expecting the end to be a bit more "realistic" not "feel good movie" ending...)
5 WATER FOR ELEPHANTS by Sara GruenThis is a marvelous book that covers the two bookends of the long adventurous life of Jacob Jankowski, going back and forth from him as a ninety-plus-year old in an assisted living facility, to him thinking back to his days working on the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus that moved around the country in its own train.He is all alone in the nursing home, with most the employees viewing him as more trouble than he is worth, except for one wonderful nurse named Rosemary, who shows him respect and compassion, and is for all practical purposes his only friend at this point in his life. While he has many family members, his children are now old themselves and the family in general has moved on without him. They take turns visiting him, but he gets the feeling their hearts are not into it.Mr. Jankowski maintains his sanity by thinking back to his days as a young man in his prime. The story into the past begins with him finishing up veterinary school at Cornel. His plan is to join his father's practice, but, just before he finishes his final exam, he gets the news that his parents have been killed in a car wreck. To add to the tragedy, he finds out that his parents were bankrupt and losing their family house and everything they own, a result of the bad economy and them putting all their money into Jacob's education at Cornel. He responds by joining the Benzini Brothers Greatest Show on Earth.His journey down memory lane provides us a rich assortment of protagonists and antagonists, and a loving, touching account of the animals that were under his care as the official veterinarian of the circus. He falls in love with the star of the circus, but she is married to a brute, having been sold off to him while she was still a child. Jacob has constant run ins with her lover, as the man is in charge of training the animals for the circus acts. The man is a barbarian, often mistreating the animals, his wife, the workers, and he and Jacob rumble several times.The owner of the circus is a two-bit conman that often physically abuses his workers, and more often than not--it seems--fails to pay them. This of course leads to great friction with the working men, some of whom disappear during some of the train rides, thrown off the moving train under the orders of the mad man in charge of the circus.Along the way, the circus picks up a prized elephant, named Rosie, who does not respond to any commands and is judged to be a worthless animal with an alarming appetite. The trainer responds by beating the elephant on several occasions. Jacob intervenes and figures out the elephant responds to Polish, which provides the circus new life, with Rosie emerging as the star of the circus, along with Jacob's love, Marlena.There are several wonderful side stories that outline the struggles of the wonderful array of characters that make up the circus crew. They travel around in the Depression, attempting to survive when most circuses are folding their tents and going out of business.I loved the ninety-plus-year old Jacob and especially his flashbacks to earlier days that showed the wonders, dangers, opportunities, underhandedness, splendors and tragedies of life on the train circus. The story tells how difficult it is to age, to become old, to be viewed as no longer capable of living a normal life. It also is a story that tells us to follow our dreams when we are young and do all we can to make them come true.Ms. Gruen provides a fitting ending to the book. I will not spoil it for you, but you are certain to like and appreciate it.This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend.Hey Joe (Jamaica Series)
5 Sure "Water for Elephants" has been around and even turned into a movie, but I've only just now read the book.  I'll have to go and see the movie . . . if only to see the director's interpretation of the glorious scenes of circus life this book conjures up in the reader's mind.Judging by the number of people who took time out to write reviews for this book, I must say it lives up to the critical acclaim in just about every way possible.  At least for this reader it did. Every writer knows that in order to keep the readers' attention a novel must have tension on every page.  This novel is almost the illustration of that rule.  I loved taking the trip.  I highly recommend this book to almost anyone.  I think it will become a classic.This is masterful writing and I've passed it on to my sister who is now devouring it whole.  Congratulations to Sara Gruen for producing this stunning page-turner.  I absolutely loved it!5 Stars.  Great Read!
4 I enjoyed this book a lot, despite the fact that some of the stuff said doesn't match the era in which it was written. I wasn't as bothered by the small issues as some of the other reviewers were, apparently. It is a work of fiction after all. Sure, there were quite a few cliches, but not to the point of distraction. I liked the animals and their personalities, namely Rosie, the star of the show. She stole my heart and when she was a victim of violence, my heart broke for her.Having the old man relive his memories of the circus was very compelling and tied the story of then and now together nicely. The ending made me cry, but not why you'd expect.
4 With all the "hype" about this book, I was expecting more-more plot,and a more interesting main character. And really it reads like a script. So often the author does too much explaining about how each character is sitting, their reaction,etc. as if in preparation for a movie,with too much explaining how the actors should perform.I do like the depression era and the circus theme , which drew me to the book.I am looking forward to seeing the movie but mostly because of the actors in it.All in all I didnt care for the authors way of writing. But I think it will make for an interesting movie.
2 Required no thinking. Boring and trite. I can't imagine why this book is so popular. (In fact, I read it a few years ago but it popped up here and I wanted to review it now to give another point of view to the multitudes who adored it.)
4 I loved this book and didn't expect to because I've never been a fan of the circus. The novel seamlessly alternates between two periods of Jacob's life, beginning when he was in his early 20s, having lost everything after the death of his parents (the impetus for his joining the circus) and as an elderly man in a nursing home.I was especially moved by the author's clear respect for older people through her portrayal of Jacob and the other residents of the nursing home. The conversations between Rosemary and Jacob were deeply touching and I loved the way Rosemary gently explained to Jacob why the man might have lied about carrying water for elephants at the circus. Oh, and the ending was just beautiful. I was rooting for Jacob all the way!I was also fascinated by some of the historical bits such as redlighting and Jake Leg, a disease some people got (usually poor people) from drinking Jamaican Ginger Extract during the Prohibition Era. And I can't forget Rosie, the amazing elephant and where she spent her final years - This was a book I could not put down!  I guess the only
5 This book was suggested to me by a friend and I wasn't sure I would like it. As soon as I started reading I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I read it in about a week.  This particular book earned it's place on the New York Bestsellers list for a reason.An elderly man, looking back on the past and how it has shaped him now.  The book is set in the present day as well as the early 1930's.  It paints the picture of exactly what I would think a traveling circus would be during that time.  It is full of drama within in the reigns of the circus as far as the everyday workers, performers, and animals. From cover to cover the reader does not know exactly what to expect.  I would suggest this book to anyone.One of the best books I have read in some time.  I can't wait to see the movie!
5 I normally don't select bestsellers for reading pleasure; they so often disappoint. Had my book club not selected this for discussion I probably would not have read it. But I am so glad I did. The book is well writen, not just a good story, but excellent writer's craft. Any person over fifty with any empathy at all will identify with the story teller. Younger people will identify with the main characters in the circus story. I am not particularly interested in circus history, but this was fascinating. The ending is especially wonderful...fanciful but wonderful.
2 I couldn't really get into the book.  Still have not seen the movie either but to me the book starts out slow and I hate books like that
5 This book is as advertised. I meant to pick it up a while ago and then bought it after seeing previews of the movie. Highly recommend.
5 It took me a bit to get into this book. I'm not sure why - but mostly it is probably because my days have started out so busy, I don't get around to reading til I'm already exhausted. Once I got into it, I couldn't stop reading. I stayed up too late, I read until I fell asleep, and then got irritated when I woke up and didn't have time to finish the book. :) It really only took a few hours, it was just finding those few hours to read.Great summer read, beautiful love story, and definitely makes me want to FINALLY see a circus. Yes, I'm 35 and have not been to a circus (that I remember)!***SPOILER ALERT***Don't read any further if you haven't read the book, or get upset by spoilers. Because this will give a few things away.First, a preface ... I love the line because it reminds me of the kind of person I *want* in my life. Faced with a 10ft thick, 100ft tall wall of obstacles, he KNOWS he's on the losing end, but doesn't give up or freak out.My favorite line in the book, "Dear God. Not only am I unemployed and homeless, but I also have a pregnant woman, bereaved dog, elephant, and eleven horses to take care of."This line made me giggle out loud, and it brightened my whole day.
5 This is the perfect example of a good book really being about HOW the story is told. It's a good story, but the author's skill in making this a captivating read is undeniable. Read it!
5 True to Amazon.com order came on time and in perfect condition. If you have not read this book, read it!! Had read in on my Kindle and wanted hard copy for my book shelves.
5 I'm not a real fan of fiction, only because fiction does not keep me tuned in to the story line. Often the subject matter rambles on before the story line gets going when  you finally know what you are reading about.Water for Elephants is a well written novel. The title fascinated me to begin with, and excerpts led me to believe this was going to be a good read. I was right!  The story line is never boring, it's uncomplicated, and keeps you tuned in to events as they unravel. So well done. I encourage anyone who is an avid reader to buy a copy. You won't be disappointed.
5 What a wonderful read!! Once I got into the book I was lost on a train in a circus and I never wanted to leave my new world.  I really enjoyed this book and would reccomend it to everybody that enjoys a good read.  I was also excited that the train went through my towns of Keokuk, Hamilton, and Burlington how exciting!!!!!
4 Good book.  I didn't care how accurate the information was.  I found it hard to put it down.
3 This really is an excellent book with an interesting story and well-conceived details.  I listened to the audio version, which was particularly well acted.  My complaint with the book is that it is blatantly anti-Jewish.  The circus leaders, who are described as Jewish, are mean and spiteful, making the lives of the workers a living hell.  Why did Ms. Gruen need to assign a religion to them? I found this really offensive, and played into negative Jewish stereotypes.  My other complaint with the book is that the two Jacobs don't seem like the same person (I'm assuming they are although I'm not quite finished with the book).  One is loving and mild-mannered, the other cantankerous and bitter.  Can these really be the same person?
3 Water for Elephants is the break-out runaway hit first novel by Sara Gruen.  It's a classic down on his luck boy meets out of his league girl and they fall madly in love story.  Except the story is set in a cruel and gritty circus world of the Depression, which only makes the story more interesting.Gruen's story is well told and written, and she does a good job portraying the everyday cruely of circus life during the hard times of the Great Depression. She creates several interesting and memorable characters--from the scrappy Camel to the manic August.  And several of the circus scenes allow the reader to paint a vivid mental picture, which is always key to a fascinating novel.I'll admit that I was probably the last person in America to read this book, and as a result, I've been hearing about how fantastic it was for three years.  Unfortunately, the book had a hard time living up to these expectations.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the great romance/historical novel I was expecting.  I would still recommend that others read it, particularly to compare to the recent movie, since I thought the book had a much stronger storyline.
3 Good for a beach read but none of these characters are memorable. This book doesnt hold a candle to "Racing in the rain".
4 The setting and writing of this novel give it a wonderful atmosphere. The only thing holding it back is the romance, not that I did not root for the conclusion, but would have enjoyed more of a reason for the couple to be together besides circumstance. That being said, the characters are well built and the world the inhabit fascinating.
5 A truly fascinating novel - for those of us old enough to remember going to the circus in small towns during the summer and now old enough to share the anxiety and depression of aging it covered the whole gamut.  Only the treatment of both animals and those on the low end of the pay scale could be considered distracting from the good memories.
4 I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a perfect summer read.  The ending was a heart jerker but made you feel good.  I say you should like the circus, but you may just learn to through this book.  I'm old enough to remember the traveling circus coming to our small town, and I fear that is going to be a thing of the past----too bad.
5 This is a book I cannot forget; it stirred me deeply.  Yes, the story telling is brilliant and extremely well written; the parts about the depression and the circus are fascinating; and the ability of a young female author to give voice and depth of character to an old man in his nineties is extraordinary (he is one of literature's most memorable characters!)But for me, there is something which surpasses even all of this.  Gruen touched on and developed a reality with which it is so difficult for most of us to come to grips: that is how the strong, virile, resourceful young man in his twenties continues to reside in the decrepit, rotting body of the stooped, weak old man.  She has drawn so clearly the ungraspable mystery of youth emerging into old age, the spirit of the person masked by the wrinkled cloak of the elderly.  Bravo, Sara.  Well done!
2 Like many who were critical of this book, I truly did want to love it. However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down. Jacob was infuriating as he claimed to love these animals and then becomes sexually sidetracked while his Rosie was being beaten half to death. It made me sick to my stomach. Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story.
4 An enjoyable read.  The background of the circus did not deflect from relating to the clients. Seeing the past through the eyes of the 93 year old protagonist was wonderful.
5 Book Was Great. Easy to read & follow. Circus Drama page turner with a love story. I thought Rosie was brilliant !!
5 I read this book on my Kindle.  It was the first e-book I ordered, avout 2 years ago.  I don't know why my review has been so delayed, but this truly is a marvelous love story!  No wonder it was on the best-seller list for so long.  I would recommend reading the book before you see the movie as the author's ability to describe the scenes and emotions is a fascinating read.
5 This book was a fantastic read, absolutely wonderful.  I was hooked from the moment I began reading and didn't put it down until I was finished with it!
5 This story is now in my top 10 best loved stories.  Now that says something!!!!Jacob Jankowski is a cranky but very likable 93 yr old man who lives in an assisted living center.He is strong willed and has opinions on so many of the other people who live in the centre with him. His body has degenerated and he doesn't want to look in the mirror any more as he does not reconise himself anymore.  He becomes the trouble maker of the group as his mind is sharp  not like his degenerated body.Jacob remembers the circumstances under which he found himself homeless and travelling with the Benzini Brothers Circus. He alternates between the past and his day to day living with his co-workers of the circus going weeks without being paid, and some nights some workers would disappear during the night (the bosses would organise for them to be thrown off a moving train). He sleeps on a horse blanket on the train floor just thankful for a meal and a job.1931 is a hard time during the depression and everyone will do anything just to survive.The world couldn't be any tougher for this young man.This is one of the most moving stories i have ever listened to on Audio cd.A must for everyones collection.
4 this author is a master story teller and she had me from the first.  The structure of the book is captivating, back and forth from the nursing home where the main character lives out his old age to the fascinating life he has led as a veternarian for the circus and his love affair with the main act.  and that is only the beginning.  It is the story of coming of age in a most unconventional setting.  I learned so much about the inner workings of a circus.  So why oh why did the author end the book on such a maudlin, unrealistic note.  Sarah Gruen forced a happy ending on a story that deserved a more intelligent finale.  Still it is deffinately worth the read.
5 I just finished reading Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.  It was one of my most favorite reads to date, and I read alot of books!  I loved how the book started in the nursing home with the older Jacob and how he reveiled how it felt to be old and most of the time forgotten.  His family viewed it as a duty to go and visit him..And then it switches to a young Jacob and tells the story of his adventures working in a circus.  For anyone who wanted to run away to the circus as a child, you will definately love this book.  I could not put it down. It is exciting one minute and has you on the edge of your seat and the next it is endearing and makes you feel like you really know the characters.  I give this book 5 stars and if you want a really good read, you will do the same.
5 After "Riding Lessons", which I loved - and "Flying Changes", which was a huge disappointment to me, I was not sure what I would find in "Water for Elephants".  Wow - what a great read!  Research does pay off hugely - when it enables a writer to place the reader inside another world so easily - the world of the circus. This was a world totally foreign to most of us - but now, so familiar, thanks to Sara.  This book satisfied my three requirements - transportation (take me away from all this),  levitation (lift my spirits and leave me thinking good thoughts) and infiltration (let me get inside the characters so I feel I really know them). Reading "Water for Elephants" is time well-spent.  I'm happy to know Sara is working on a fourth book. I'll be first in line to buy it.
5 Great summer read
5 Quite delightful - for all ages, teens, and adults - - - a good book to give as a gift  - a surefire read. Barbara Pontecorvo
5 On a scale of one to ten, I rate this book a ten.  It is a very unusual story and makes for a good satisfying read.  The characters really come alive in this book and you can almost picture the circus.  This would make a great movie!
5 I was reluctant to read this book because I'm not a fan of the circus. While there is animal cruelty in here, you also see how people who traveled with the circus were treated in much the same way as the animals. The ending is a nice surprise. Jacob and Rosie will stay with you for a long time.
1 I thought this book would be outstanding by all the really good reviews it got. But I only read about 3 1/2 chapters and called it quits. I just thought it was very dull reading. I thought perhaps, I would try again at some point to read it..but after thinking about that idea for a while--I decided that I wouldn't try reading it again. I will say I was disappointed; I will also say I would not suggest to anyone to read this book.  :(
4 I really loved this story, especially the ending.  I really enjoyed hearing about circus life, which surprised me, I'm not a fan of the circus at all.  I thought Sara Gruen did a great job telling this story but I would have like to have seen a little more character development.  It also had a little extra appeal for me as the story starts out in Ithaca, NY not far from where I grew up and not far from where I live now.
5 I couldn't put this book down, from the first page to the last, I was swept away with every detail of Circus life and then back to the reality of Mr. Jankowski.  I would recommend this book highly for anyone who enjoys stories of the past put against today's reality.Thank you for a good read.
5 I enjoyed this book as evidenced by the fact that it only took me a few days to read.  The characters are engrossing and realistic.  It is amazing that Sara was able to write the part of an old man with such realism. When I read a book, I also like to learn well researched real facts. This book did not disappoint in that area. The history is interesting and accurate.  The end of the book is satisfying.  If you would like to "get lost" in a great book, this is a good choice.
5 This book is for those aching for just a good story to read.  A great piece of fiction.  Set in the Depression, there are intriguing, indepth and sometimes horrific details about Circus life intertwined in a simple but classic love story.you will love to turn the page to find out what else can happen to the character.Dont wait to read this!! This book is a sure thing.
5 I was a bit hesitant about reading this book, I kept reading that it was about circuses, and I really didn't think I had too much of and interest. Boy was I wrong. It starts with a murder and winds and weaves you through the story of life in the traveling circus and back to present day in a nursing home.  The book had my attention from page one and still has me even though I finished reading it. There is humor, love, murder, and friendship, and a whole lot of history about the circus, and circus life making this book a well rounded engaging read.
5 I think this is the first book I have read just because everyone else seemed to be reading it. Usually that is not a very good recommendation. I am glad I did not miss it because of my rather arragant opinion of other peoples reading tastes.
5 I loved this story.  The story is entertaining and the reading is relaxing.  I highly recommend this book.
5 "Water for Elephants" by Sara Gruen is an utter delight. I read a library copy for my book club, but after I finished I promptly ordered three copies: for my father, for a favorite aunt, and for my husband. I had to restrain myself from buying more.The book is narrated from the point of view of Jacob Jankowski, a ninety-plus year old man living in a nursing home. He is unhappy with everything about his current situation in life. He constantly flails against the every-present reminders that his body has degenerated so that he hardly recognizes himself. He's become the trouble-making curmudgeon of the facility because his mind is fully alive and has not degenerated along with his body.When a circus comes to town and sets itself up across the street, one of the old coots living in the same home brags that he used to work in the circus carrying "water for elephants." This gets Jacob's ire up. He knows you can't carry water to elephants. They drink too much! The man is lying. Jacob knows the truth because he really did work in the circus. But those memories are long buried. Now that thoughts of this part of his past are awakened, he starts thinking about those halcyon days of his youth--a time when he learned quickly how to become a man.Thus the story of Jacob joining the circus when he was 23, during the heart of the Depression, when he had nothing in the world he could call his own except promise, inner strength, and fortitude. The world couldn't get any tougher for a young man. He learns quickly, and the hard way about many of the most important lessons in life, and he comes away from the experience a remarkably mature, whole, and admirable man.Two-thirds of the book deals with chapters about Jacob as a young man in the circus. One-third deals with Jacob in the nursing home. It is a proper balance and this construction adds to the tension of the story rather than detracts. You care about this man and root for him in both periods of his life.There is a marvelous feel-good ending, full of great humanity. When you finish, you are left with optimism and enthusiasm that sticks with you for a long time. I recommend this book highly. It is a book that can be appreciated by all ages; in fact, I think it would make an enjoyable and thought-provoking young adult title--but for those men and women who actually went through the Great Depression, this book is a treasure. Buy it for every one of those beloved survivors that you have in your immediate circle of friends and family. These people want for nothing material. It is hard to buy presents for them. But this book will be greeted by long-lasting appreciation.
2 ...but I just couldn't.  Honestly, it stressed me out.  I wasn't enchanted or transported, just full of anxiety at the turn of every page.  I read a lot of books, and I review very few, but this is a book I really wanted to love and had to force myself to finish.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of "Carter Beats the Devil", but instead I got "The Devil tortures Carter and his girl and Carter ends up alone in a nursing home."  I just couldn't get behind this story.
5 This one of those watch the movie before you read the book! Cause I did it the other way around and kept waiting for things from the book! I loved the book, I read my sister's copy and then decided I needed a copy of my own. And I am rereading it and loving it even more!
5 A couple of years ago a friend gave me a copy of Water For Elephants. I put it aside until a few days ago, at which time I thought I should probably read it. I was hooked from the very beginning and couldn't put the book down. Although, I have never been interested in elephants, I fell in love with Rosie and her sweet personality. Did you know that elephants cry and that they have a huge hippocampus, a brain structure that's important in processing emotions? After finishing the book, I immediately Googled elephants to learn more about these intelligent animals. Water For Elephants has become one of my favorite novels. If you haven't read this one, you are definitely missing a modern classic.
5 The book was easy 4 hour read...there is some vulgarity that was unexpected..but I would just say it's not for grade school readers. There were parts that made me laugh and parts that nearly made me cry...that's good writing.:)
5 This is one of my favorite books! I love it so much I gave it to 5 people as gifts!!!
4 I purchased this book on someone else's recommendation. It was not at all what I thought it would be, but I did enjoy it and passed it on to someone else. The book is better than the movie.
4 I started reading Water for elephants after watching the movie trailer. I loved it and after going to the cinema I have to say that the novel is really really better. There are more elements than the love story the movie tells. The historical period is described well, the characters are more interesting and Jacob's everyday life is one of the best descriptions of what an old man thinks and feels when he is far from his family.It's an amazing book and even if you're not an english native speaker (as I am) it's an easy read
5 Entertaining plot, engaging characters portrayed in sufficient depth.  I've not seen the movie, so I can't make that particular comparison.  But I can vouch that the novel stands on its own.  Makes me want to read another novel by this author.
5 I loved getting to know each character and could not put the book down. This is a must read for anyone.
5 This book is absolutely charming and endearing.  It combines romance and hatred, excitement and terror.  It's a well written story that goes back and forth from  a sometimes cranky 90-something year old man and his 23 year old self.  I highly recommend it for teens and up.
5 This is about a circus around in the 30's. It is a good book. You would like it too. I would recomment it.
5 This is such a delightful story. I laughed, I cryed. I loved all the characters. It really gave you a peak into the lives of circus life and the difficulties they endure as well as the relationships. Great read whether hard copy or audio. I highly recommend reading it.
5 This book is fascinating.  Not only a good book but a lesson on early 20th century America.  Classically written!
4 This is a good book, and better than the movie (as is often the case). I did really enjoy it.
1 It took me approximately 8 hours over the course of a week to read this garbage, and in retrospect I can certainly  think of things I would rather have been doing for that 8 hours, like, say, setting my hair on fire or arm-wrestling a 400 lb orangutang.  I reckon those activities would have been more fun and fulfilling.This is a truly bad novel.  Truly bad.  The writing is amateurish, the dramatic tension poorly developed, the dialogue awful and the character development is shallow and one-dimensional.  I could not get over how stilted and poor the writing was.  Our newly orphaned hero, Jacob Jankowski, dropped out of Cornell before his final vet exam, jumped a train containing the Benzini Bros travelling circus, got taken on as the circus vet, instantly fell hopelessly in love with one of the married showgirls despite spending barely any time alone with her, took on a cookie-cutter baddie to boot (boo, hiss!) and survived to live happily ever after to a ripe old age.  So there's the plot outline, which initially showed some promise.  Pity Ms Gruen did very little with it that didn't come across as a below par submission to a Creative Writing 101 Workshop.  Probably one of the worst books I've read this decade.  Under no circumstances read this poor excuse for a novel.  The fact that so many reviewers have given it 5-stars is a mystery on par with the Bermuda Triangle. Is it collective hysteria? I just don't get it.
5 My husband read this book and really enjoyed it, and he doesn't read very often. Now I need to read, sometime in the near future.
4 I can definitely see why this book gets five stars from a lot of readers -it has fascinating period detail, an involving (if fantastical) romance, and plenty of action.So to explain my only-four stars, I must confess I "read" the audiobook version - and I was of two minds about it.  Yes, the details about circus life were interesting, and the romance was gripping in a kind of 1930s way.  But there were a lot of things that didn't make sense to me (circuses are going broke right and left, but the star performers appear rich, wearing tuxedos and drinking champagne), and for my money the bad guys were too bad and the good guys too entirely good.  The minor characters (the little person, the hootch dancer, etc.) were more complete than the leads.It would make a heckuva film though - drama, chase scenes on the top of train cars, etc.I also confess that the audio version  may have added to my bad humor - there was one fellow playing the older narrator who was really superb, but the fellow reading the part of the young hero was whiny in the extreme (what did she see in him?.
4 This is a well-written, cute story.  I certainly achieved the `suspension of disbelief' that one looks for in a summer novel.  I empathized with the main character, and could picture him and the others.  I feel like I know Jacob Jankowski - both the younger version in shock from losing his parents, and the older version who hates being treated like an "invalid".  Unlike some reviewers, I am not old enough to remember the circus coming to town on the train and with a parade.  In fact, the circus experience from my childhood was in a large concert venue.  Nevertheless, Gruen allows me to imagine the big top in all of its grimy glory and picture all of the alcohol loving workers and performers smuggling their drinks on the train.  What a nice escape.
5 This was a fascinating story of interesting times gone by. I couldn't put it down. I loved the way the old man went back to recall the events of his young years. The circus story was so believable.
5 Water for Elephants was a fabulous book.  I could not put it down.  The photos of Circus life back in the 30's added to the experience.  You won't be disappointed with this book as it contained lots of action, great characters, and a wonderful love story between a young man and woman and their love of the circus animals.Water for Elephants: A Novel
5 I read this book from the library before it was made into a movie... I fell in love with it and that is why I purchased this book for my Kindle..... Great book!!
5 I am so very glad that my mom insisted I read this book.  I typically shy away from stories about the elderly because it is a topic that affects me very deeply and can really be painful to read.  But after I helped care for my 92 year-old grandmother in the week before her death, my mom told me I had to read this and that I'd love it.  She wasn't wrong.The story gripped me immediately with the scene in the menagerie tent.  But I have to say that what I loved the most about this novel was the narrator, Jacob Jankowski.  I fell hard and fast for him from the very first page.  because of this, I purposely read this book slowly so that I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Jacob.  Ms. Gruen did an amazing job not only portraying the life of this man and the interesting friends and enemies he makes while being the vet for a travelling circus, but showing that the elderly have amazing stories to tell.  It showed how dignity is in danger of being lost when elderly people are treated like children once they are of a certain age, but also how so many simple things can bring that dignity back.This book was so wonderful and I found the ending to be uplifting and appropriate and extremely well done.  I wouldn't have accepted any less for this wonderful, amazing character.
2 I kept reading because I was hoping it would get better and redeem itself in the end, but it never did.  Rawness and grit do not substitute for depth.  I appreciated the accurate perspective of an elderly person.
5 This author has captured the essence of what it must feel like to be an old man who is still sharp-as-a-tack and remembers, with vivid detail, a few short months of his long life.  This book is written with clear attention to detail and descriptions of what life very well may have been like with a train circus during Prohibition and the Great Depression.  In addition to the day-to-day goings on there is the added element of several plot lines of a personal nature with feelings of love, loss, joy and sorrow.  Each character is seen from Jacob's point of view and drawn so clearly that you feel you know them personally. I want Jacob to be my friend and so will you!Definitely a book I will be recommending to most everyone!  I only wish there had not been the need for a few relatively explicit scenes as those few make this book unsuitable for my 11-year-old.  She is a voracious reader and wants to be a writer.  She could learn a thing or two about research and character development from this excellent and enjoyable book!
4 I won't elaborate on the plot as others have taken care of that. Listening to this story is tremendous, as it easily allows for the two voices of Jacob Jenkowski to be clearly heard and distinguished from one another. This book is a love story, a history lesson, a peek into different elements of humanity that have way too much realism. There were times I wanted to skip ahead because I didn't want to hear the unpleasantness taking place in the story. But of course I didn't. Because one has to endure some bad to appreciate the good. The love story is much more too, than a man and a woman - it involves the circus animals and how they instinctively know who is good and who is not. The history lesson reminds us of a lifetime ago, which really isn't so very far away - less than one hundred years, and helps us appreciate how far we have come. The peek into a reality far removed from a life I live reminds me not to take any part of my current life for granted. This is a very rich novel and one that will stick with the reader long after the last page is turned.
4 I am going to be a bad person right now and say that I do not understand the big hype for this book. I liked it, it was interesting, and I think that carnivals during the Depression are a popular theme in some recent entertainment (Carnivale, The Night Circus), and I can see why.  This book is entertaining but it is not particularly deep or special.  I listened to some of it on audio and that absolutely added to the story.
5 Very good storyline and book.  I would recommend this book to  everybody. Nice job on a great book. Thank you
5 I will be reviewing this book for our women's book club. It was a joy to read a realistic book with such a sense of humor built in. The young narrator grows and matures and skillfully helps other people and animals as well. The ending is a surprise and another delight in a most charming read!
4 This was an excellent book, and revealed the helplessness of people during the depression years when there were no jobs and they had to accept terrible working conditions and cruel employers.
5 I really loved this book. I saw the movie before the book but it was one that once I saw the movie had to read the book.
5 I truly enjoyed this book.  I loved Jacob as an older man,remembering his youth.  It was very well written and kept my interest from beginning to the end.  I also enjoyed the notes at the end, detailing her research experiences.  I love ELEPHANTS and enjoyed the authors characterzation of Rosie.  The people all had very interesting and different personalities.
4 Jacob Jankowski is about to take his final veterinary exams at Cornell University when his parents are killed in a road accident. He then discovers that his father has been working as a vet, free of charge, during these early depression years, leaving Jacob penniless and unable to afford to stay at school to finish his exams. He hops a circus train which is going through the town and is hired as the show's vet, virtually unpaid by the avaricious circus owner, and sleeping in a train carriage with horses and the circus "little person". The cast of circus characters, both performers and roustabouts, as the workers are called, provides an interesting back drop to a story of love, manic hatred and cruelty, especially on the part of one of the trainers who has charge of an elephant named Rosie. The story progresses right through Jacob's life until his nineties when, with his frail body but intact memory, he relives his colourful past. It's an entertaining read and the story, the details of which have been thoroughly authenticated by the author, makes a change from anything I've read previously.
2 Did not like the book.  I especially didn't like the fact that no one could stop the elephant abuse and didn't like the sex in it.  Pretty crude.  Too bad they had to add the graffic sex.  It wasn't necessary to the story!
1 I did not like the language or the story. I have not finished the the book and have no interest in doing so
5 Jacob Jankowsky is 90...or 93.  He can never remember.  As the book begins, he is a "resident" in an assisted living facility, so I related to it right off, having just spent 2 days with my mother-in-law at an assisted living facility.  As Jacob begins to look backward, we discover that he was "orphaned" as he was getting ready to take his exams for his veterinary license and join his father's practice.  When his parents are killed in an auto accident, he is left with no money and, through an accidental twist of fate, he joins a circus, where he becomes the resident veterinarian.  Over the next four months he learns the good and the bad about circus life, falls in love, discovers the secret of the newly acquired "stupid" elephant, and witnesses the one of the worst circus disasters in history.Gruen is a wonderful writer, with a rich use of language which paints vivid pictures of a world most of us have never experienced.  This is a riveting story with a couple of surprising twists at the end that I didn't see coming.I highly recommend this book.
4 Gruen not only tells a good story about the early circus trains, but she also uses her research to add credibility.  Her sophisticated style and vocabulary make for pleasurable reading.
4 I don't know why, but when I read a little "blip" somewhere about this book, something told me I would really enjoy it. I mostly read psychological thrillers and this book was so different from anything I have ever read, but I felt as if I was actually transported to the time and place of this unusual, interesting read. My 90 year old Mom read it, too, and also loved it.  It's warm, endearing and so well written.
5 The novel is sure a pleasant surprise. First, I like how the author interlaces the novel between the perspective of the older and younger antagonists. Mr Jankowski is animated and adorable. I felt like I could really take a glimpse inside an old person's mild. He is a young guy trapped in an old man's body. Jacob is young and innocent, but not as memorable as his older self. The adventure he had is almost like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Sure, there were times I was confused. It doesn't seem so believable to have a college graduate jumping from one railcar to another, and the sex scene is unnecessarily. (I guess female readers demand certain rewards with reading romance novels.) {Spoiler Alert} I still don't understand why Uncle Al needs August for the circus. It seems like Uncle Al could have just replaced August with Jacob and the novel will shortened by half.I wish Ms Gruen all the best and am looking forward to her coming books.
4 "Water for Elephants" is a good read.  The writer confesses to being thrilled to be writing something besides technical documents, and this gives rise to minor annoyances, some as trivial as the overuse of "stare".The contrast of mores of the Depression Era to modern day is arrestingly authentic.  Using 1930's circus lingo is misleading (a "bull" elephant named Rosie).The symbolism that is not overtly contrived (the big circus in the sky) is captivating, but there is an the almost desperate struggle to parallel the narrator with the biblical story of Jacob.
5 Good book. I liked the movie, but  I loved the book...Slow read but a good read. It had much more information
5 This is the story of Jacob J from two points of view - Jacob the old man, in the "assisted living" facility and Jacob the young man, newly orphaned, trying to make his way in the world.Jacob the elder is a grumpy old curmudgeon. And, as you read the book, from his POV, you understand why. His body has failed him, his mind isn't as sharp as it was, and his keepers treat him like a child. He is unbelievably frustrated. But he has a family that visits him regularly, and he has something to look forward to. The circus has come to town.Seeing the circus has taken him back to his youth, during the depression, when he ran away from life and joined the circus. The chapters that take place during this point in time are riveting, capturing the essence of what we could never experience.There's mystery, romance, and some really great characters. And, I think the author does a good job of capturing the essence of this proud male character. Great read.
5 Seeing Jacob young and old, and hearing how time affected him, and how he still remained connected to his history after all those years was  great. It really added to the book and really tied the story together for me. It was very dramatic for me to see how this once active and interesting man was effected by the years, and what age does to a person. It made me think how we cast aside many of our elderly friends and folks not paying attention to their stories. Especially key when thinking alone about Jacob's past. I have a great love and respect for elephants and at many times i was so angered in the story and could feel the emotions that Jacob was experiencing. It was such a strong event that occurred with Rosie, and without giving the story away was vindicating. Really don't want to watch the movie now as afraid would not live up to how i imagined everything or if they changed the story too much.
2 Good concept in terms of time, place and description of depression era circus life.  Writing is passable, but observations on human character are WEAK.  I regret reading this and should have just gone to the movie.
5 This book is firmly positioned in my top 10 best reads ever. A riveting plot with full, rich characters (including the animals), written in simple yet powerful prose. The way in which the two storylines (old Jacob and young Jacob) are intertwined is masterful, and the conclusion of each, equally satisfying. A truly wonderful book.
2 So much has already been written about the shallow characters and implausible ending... So no need to belabor that point.However, I do want to throw up a Red Flag to those readers who, like me, aren't big fans of profanity. I listened to Water for Elephants on CD and found myself cringing repeatedly at the author's liberal use of the F-word. (And many other words.) Furthermore, the graphic sexuality felt like the author's attempt to titillate and shock her readers with needless cheap thrills. She provided ample details regarding the sexual habits of her characters whilst omitting more relevant ones regarding central relationships and motives.There was an interesting storyline in there somewhere. As to the rest, it could've been toned down.
5 Great and dramatic character development, some you love, some you care about, some you hate and one or two you simply loathe...great characters living life with all of its pathos, humor and drama in a Depression era circus...Some points will make you laugh out loud, some smile in suprise and some where you want to say, "That sorry, no good SOB..."  Some will make you gasp in joy and delight, one or two in horror. All in all, a very good book....The characters, the pathos and the humor, the living of life, make it come alive and stay with you long after the last page is turned.  I was sorry to seen it end, and that is the way a good book is supposed to leave you. This one is good, though it never really talks about or explains the title "Water for Elephants..."
2 borrowed this book from the kindle library and only had it a day before I ended up returning it....i found the parts that I read pornographic and vulgar...makes me sad for the world and those that AREN'T bothered by such things...guess I should just stick to the young adult novels...*sigh*
5 I never would have read a book about the circus but this was recommended by a friend and I loved it. Don't let the subject matter distract you from a great novel!
5 I ended up caring deeply about the characters and the narrative was strong.  The setting of the novel in a circus was a stroke of genius.  The writing was strong and fluid, not masterwork material though.  But hey, if you want to read a masterpiece read one.
5 The perfect ending in any book I have read in a loing time. What looked like a sad ending turned out to be inspiring instead. I must say I adore this book.
5 Best book I've read in a while. Interesting, unusual, great characters. Once again pointing out the incredible spread of compassion and evil that humans are capable of. The book felt very real but also had times where it was magical. Loved it.
3 I was excited because I suspected that this was a book must have been written for me. I have always been a circus enthusiast and I was particularly interested in the details and the workings of a circus during the depression era.  The amount of research is impressive.  I agree with the other reviewers that the sections concerning the old man in the nursing home were probably the best written.  Unfortunately, the part that I had the least patience with is the love triangle.  That, of course, is the main engine for the plot. I didn't think the writting was as clunky as some claimed. I would have liked to have known more about the elephant. Where I'm from the nursing home takes all those who want to go to the circus or where ever, even if it is 60 miles away. And what's this deal with people writting novels about characters and events that are as far removed from themselves as possible?  It must be a reaction against Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, etc., but those were some pretty good writers. I enjoyed the topic, but I hoped to like this book more.
5 I was a little reluctant to read this as the context of a circus didn't excite me.  But on the recommendation of a friend, I picked it up.  I was quickly drawn into the story and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The ending was a bit of a stretch, but having been drawn into the characters, it was still satisfying.
4 I had a hard time putting this book down, not because it was action packed or particularly fast paced, but because the development, sincerity and engaging voice of the main character at both stages of his life was refreshingly flawless. The voice remains true and believable throughout the entire narrative and is well developed giving me a clear picture of who Jacob Jankowski is and why I should care. Because this is achieved, I am fully invested in his world and experiences. Like wise, the supporting characters are dynamic and interesting, but even given their deformities, whether physical or psychologically, they never over shadow the main character.The book provokes thoughts on treatment and intelligence of animals, economy, marriage, class, race, healthcare, friendship and family. As well as, it forces us to take a hard look at how our culture deals with the elderly."Sometimes the monotony of bingo and sing-alongs and ancient dusty people parked in the hallway in wheelchairs makes me long for death. Particularly when I remember that I'm one of the ancient dusty people, filed away like some worthless tchotchke."If I had to give a 'con' to the book, it would be toward the ending when the author simplifies Jacob's journey with a 'run away with the circus' solution. However, this does not disappoint and in a way is the logical path and most appropriate ending given the character's circumstances and alternative. It is the happiest it can get.
5 Loved this book.  Thought it might be depressing in the beginning but soon became gripped in the twists and turns off the plot.  Quite a colorful ride.
5 Definately in my top ten favorites of all time!!! I read it in a day and a half!!
5 Seldom has a book moved me as much as this one did.  Perhaps it's because I listened to the audiobook version, and the narrators voices were perfect for the different stages of life in the book.  Perhaps it's because my 98 year old mother-in-law is in a nursing home, but the author captured what life for a 90+ year old must be like in a nursing home facility.  In addition, I LOVE the circus, even though today's pale in comparison to those that were under canvas.  Without doing a spoiler, I can only say that it's been a long time since the ending of a book brought tears to my eyes.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
5 This novel was absolutely fabulous.  I liked the way the author bounced back and forth from the past to the present.  I could really feel the many struggles the characters were having by the way the author got into their minds.  Terrific story with interesting photos to make it so real.
5 What a great story! My wife has been wanting to watch the movie so I had to hurry up and read the book. It is a very charming love story played out on the set of a traveling circus. The times are hard, but true love for both people and animals finds a way to shine through. Loved, loved the ending!
4 This was a fun book that was easy to read and follow. The author brought the reader to the circus! The main character suffered a tragedy that he literally was running a way from when he found himself eventually working in a circus.  As the reader, you then go through the journey of his life in the circus as a young man, where he experiences life, love, and tragedy. I appreciate the ending of the book, and thought it was a nice ending to his life journey.
4 I read the book. I could not watch the movie. The book was so good if you could stand the feelings of the circus and what it was doing to him and the love he felt for her.
5 Very good story. I liked the story being told from the old man's memories and his current life. It is a story rich with characters.
3 I've never been big on circuses, so I was not expecting to like this book. However, Jacob was a sympathetic character, especially as an elderly man whose family seemed to visit him in his nursing home out of obligation.
5 WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a sweeping story of nearly epic proportions that touches on the young, the old, and lost loves, all within one man's life.His name is Jacob Janowski, a grumbling old 93-year-old (or is it 90-year-old?) fart living in an old folks home. Enduring his final days with other old folks, Jacob loathes his surroundings and how he is treated by the medical staff. Then, one day, a circus sets up stakes not far from Jacob's retirement facility and memories of life-gone-by come flooding back to him.We time-travel with Jacob (in his mind, not the science fiction kind), and learn of a short span that changed Jacob's life. Preparing for his final exams in veterinary school, Jacob soon learns of his parents' demise in a deadly car accident. Running away from his problems, Jacob joins up with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Hired on initially as a rube, Jacob's talents with animals soon come to light and he's assigned as the shows official vet. But trouble, love, and loss await him as he travels the rails with the show. Falling for a married woman, trying to fit in with the grunts versus the performers, battling the show's muscle-bound brutes that carry out Uncle Al's orders (Uncle Al owns the show) and trying to keep from being red-lighted (being thrown from the train), Jacob's short stint in the circus circuit changes everything about him.Author Sara Gruen's easy reading style lends itself to a fast, fun, and interesting read. It also, surprisingly, has a ton of character depth, and not just for human characters but for the animals Jacob tends. Particularly that of Rosie the "dumb as hammers" elephant that turns out to be much, much more than what she seems.The ending to WATER FOR ELEPHANTS was absolutely perfect, letting us know that even though the elderly can be crotchety, they serve a much greater purpose than to be wheeled around in chairs and told when, what and where to eat, drink, and think. Finding a home where one belongs is the toughest thing when people get older, and it was a fantastic ending for Jacob to "go home" to when the final sentence gets read.
5 LOVED LOVED LOVED this book, and the author paints such a wonderful, detailed picture of each character, no matter how profound to the story. I could not put this book down.If you are offended by sexual content or 'colorful' language, maybe it's not the best read for you. But understand that the content is part of the raw nature of the circus life during that time.
5 Rarely do I enjoy books that are recommended to me as much as I enjoyed Sara Gruen's 'Water For Elephants'. A charming, touching, entertaining read from start to finish; the book's frequent 'travels in time' from a depression era college boy experiencing loss and uncertainty at a young age to a 90+ year old man also experiencing loss and uncertainty, while reliving his past and trying desperately to maintain as much dignity as possible in face of his diminishing capacity with old age.The story begins with the older Jacob Jankowski, infuriated with a newer resident at his assisted living facility who, with the advent of a circus arriving nearby, delights and entertains his female dining hall companions with stories of how he carried water for elephants at the circus in his younger years. Jacob; who is incensed at this obviously false claim, and alienates himself from the rest of the residents, begins to relive, through a series of remembrances in his mind, his own experiences in the Benzini Brothers circus in his youth.With a cast as colorful as the balloons and flags that you can imagine flying over the bigtop of the Benzini Brothers circus, Jacob's internal narrative weaves a tale of love, loss, betrayal, and murder that is as fine a coming of age story as I have ever read.A thoroughly enjoyable read from start to finish.
5 I've just completed reading this book a third time. One word of advice:  Read the book BEFORE seeing the movie. While both book and film can each stand alone, reading the book first makes the movie so much more enjoyable.  The story is uniquely compelling, and the author does an excellent job of describing the life and times of a Depression-era circus. I just couldn't put the bloody book down!Like the author before writing this book, I'd never been to a circus before. However, I did grow up with Depression survivor grandparents, especially my grandmother, who was infamous locally for feeding the hobos who passed through our poor little railroad town. Even when she had little to feed her three children, the transients who spotted the hobo tags on their back fence never went away empty-handed.I have been fascinated by stories of the circus since visiting the Ringling Circus Museum in Sarasota, Florida at the age of eight. Now in my 50's, I long to see a real circus for myself.
5 Love love love this book. This book is so much more than I thought it would be. Its beautiful, exciting, eye opening, and intriguing. I fell in love with the story and its characters from the beginning. Favorite character of all?... Rosie for sure... yes the elephant. Shes innocent, smart, witty, out smarts her humans and seemingly has a wonderful personality. She is amazing. But of course this book is not just about an elephant. Its about love, hate, excitement, tyranny, rage, and some real good laughs. Definitely a book worth reading.
5 I loved this book. In fact I also listened to it on cd. Gives you a idea how circus life was or could beI am no expert on circus life but my husband worked on some. Can be fun and hard
3 While I don't completely regret reading this book about a young man who joins the circus as a vet in the 1930's, in hindsight I defintely would have chosen another book. It starts off with a bang, then slows down significantly in the middle, and it ends quite nicely. It's your typical boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl story. I did enjoy the historical fiction aspect of it and I truly enjoyed the final portion of the book where the author writes about why, how, and what she did to write this book.I'd recommend it to the causal reader, but a more sophisticated reader may want to look elsewhere.
5 I was really impressed by this book. It's an old man's retelling of his younger days at a circus. He's currently in a nursing home. What's amazing is how she takes you inside his head and causes you to see events through his eyes, and his mind. You feel his frustration, his loneliness, and how he's misunderstood.Older people in the home are treated like children, but inside, they're cognizant, at least some of the time, and resent this treatment, but are helpless to prevent it.The details in the circus era are very well written. You're taught a lot about circus life, the fun, the dangerous, the dark underbelly. Maybe it's not representative; it is fiction, but you believe it. She takes you there.One of the most enjoyable fiction books I've read.
5 I Bought this one on a whim as my favorite authors seemed to have dried up a little. I'm so glad I did, it's wonderful.Jacob Jankowski is 93 (hr thinks) and in an old folks home put out to pasture. He has an enthralling story inside him that many of us only wish we had. Dropping out of college and running away with the circus as a young man, his story unfolds as a true adventure.The circus of the 30's is the back drop for this wonderful yarn and we follow Jacob as he navigates his way around the people, the lore, the language and the pecking order. All the characters are colorful and each brings a dimension to the story that has the reader turning pages as fast as possible. I think I blew through this one in two days. I might have done it in one had I not had commitments I had to keep.The story is interspersed with up to date goings on at the old folks home the aged Jankowski is a resident of but, you can just tell his heart is still on the circus train of his youth. The end of the book is perfect in its simplicity and "rightness".To say I thoroughly enjoyed this book would somehow understate the whole experience, to say I loved it would be closer to the truth. If you want something to read that will draw you in like a moth to a flame, this might just be the book. If you want to be taken back to a bygone age of Americana complete with all its misgivings and mayhem, this might be the story. If you want to immerse yourself in a great story that, I hope becomes a movie, this IS the book.
3 SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT I READ THIS BOOK.  I HAVE OBSERVED PEOPLE READING THIS BOOK ON AIRPLANES, IN CARPOOL LINES, SITTING ON A BENCH AT BARK PARK, SO I DECIDED IT WAS A MUST READ JUST TO FEEL LIKE I BELONGED IN A SOCIETY.  THE BOOK IS INTERESTING, PARTICULARLY IF YOU WERE FASCINATED WITH THE CIRCUS AS A YOUNG CHILD.  I FOUND THE ANIMAL BRUTALITY A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT AS BRUTAL AS I HAD ANTICIPATED, BUT WHAT I DID MOSTLY REMEMBER AT THE END.  IT'S A GOOD READ, NOT A GREAT READ.  THE ONLY FLAW I WOULD MENTION IS THE NARRATOR'S VOICE WAS NOT PLAUSIBLE AS A NINETY YEAR OLD MAN.  THE AUTHOR MIGHT HAVE DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH IN THAT AREA, BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM READING THE BOOK.
5 I generally do not usually read these types of stories... I am mostly a Sci-Fi apocalyptic fan. My husband and I read this together and actually I was quite pleased with this Novel and enjoyed it very much! I found the Authors note at the end very interesting! It is a great Read! I recommend it!
4 I just loved this book.  The author certainly did her homework on this one.  Don't be turned off by the circus because the story is so much more than that.  The characters are endearing and the story wonderful to read
5 I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  I'm a voracious reader however never read a story about the circus - I found it delightful and satisfying.  The characters were powerful and colorful.  However - being a middle-aged reader it certainly didn't make me look forward to old age!  Nevertheless - a wonderful read - you won't be disappointed.
4 Wow!  There are over 1,600 reviews for this book.  That's great because this is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many.This novel is about a young man, nearly finished with his veterinary studies who, because of economic circumstances leaves school to join a circus as its resident veterinarian.This book switches back and forth from the standpoint of the veterinarian in his older years to the present time.  As an old man, he looks back at his experiences and the crises in the life of his great love, Dolly.  Dolly loves horses and elephants and is in a relationship with an abusive man who is in charge of the circus.The protagonist's relationship with his roommate, a dwarf, and the dwarf's Jack Russell Terrier, are wonderfully characterized.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and recommend it highly.
4 It was a good read. I read it on a flight and could hardly put it down.  I liked the ending.
4 Well written story of circus life, the people and circumstances that brought the traveling big top to our lives. You can almost smell the sawdust, the action, the intensity of the people who made this such a happening in the small cities of 20th century America.
5 Having aging parents, I was captivated by the opening of the book...The novel, the story in which the historical facts of the train circus are interwoven, appeals to any person's compassionate emotions...I really enjoyed the book, even beyond my expectations.
5 This is wonderful book!  Ever curious about what happens behind the scenes of a circus?  Well this story shows that it's nothing like you've ever imagined.  Jacob Jankowski is en route to become a veternarian when all of a sudden he loses his parents and everything changes.  He decides to run away and runs into a traveling circus.  He eventually gets a job with them as their "vet", and gets an inside look on the running of the circus.  But wait, now Jacob is a 90... or is it 93 year old man living in a dull nursing home.  The way that this novel flashes back and forth between the present old man and the past young Jacob as his story with the circus and the excentric characters he meets there adds a wonderful effect to this story.  It's a must read, once you pick up the book, you won't want to put it down until the end.  You'll never believe the crazyness behind the freakshows and the secretive and passionate characters behind the facade of happiness.
5 I absolutely loved this book.I am an Animal lover,and have very fond memories of my Grandma taking me to the Circus.However I was blown away by the beauty in this book.Sarah Gruen is a Very talented writer.I gave the book to my mom when she was done and she was blown away also.At the End of the book I had tears running down my face.True Storytelling Genius.Thank you Sarah for a Refreshing,Awesome ,touching read!
5 Water for Elephants is an exceptional read.  The characters are well-developed and authentic, the story entertaining and enlightening, the writing and research first rate.  All in all, a tremendous read.  I can't imagine anyone who would not enjoy this book, I highly recommend.
4 &#8203;This #1 NY Times Bestseller, Water for Elephants (&#8220;WFL&#8221;) was released as a film with Reese Witherspoon in 2011, and it offers us a timeless revelation of something that most of us could never fathom, the bygone era of traveling circus life, with grippingly real characters, at an astonishing depth from an author who is too young to know such vernacular much less in depth, and all the wretched animal smells, the poverty of that life, it's inherent tragedies, sprinkled with humor, intrigue and life&#8217;s intensity.  All of this is given to us from the senescent eyes of one "90 or 93", and it leaps through his semi-dementia-blurred eyes to his eyes as they were decades past -- the animated, vibrant mind of a large, strong and most admirable, but real, young man, Jacob/Jake Jankowski, a vetenarian, trained at Cornell University among America&#8217;s elite privileged classes, who fell into the depths of the morass of the Americana that one would expect circus-life to reflect.&#8203;Her novel is a much-heralded classic, as modern literature might define it, even if its prose are not of classical stature; the story that she weaves is captivating indeed.  She presents this historical-fiction view of circus life primarily as dialogue, very believable at that and so worth the time to read it, but it wants for more descriptive passages and philosophy to feed our starved minds.  Still, when she is of a mind to do so, she writes memorable lines, thus sprinkling her fascinating plot with tasteful, descriptive metaphors and similes which never impede the flow of the story line nor irritate the spellbound reader.  The plot drifts dreamlike between the disquieting realities of old age and its debilitating manifestations and the all-too vivid memories of circus life and the tragic and wonderful characters and griping events that then unfold.&#8203;Clearly, she has studied seniors and their halting routines in assisted living facilities, and she makes them all too real.  With this, I have two problems.  First, seniors' lives are boring and, worse, awash in sadness.  Second, for one of my age, they strike frighteningly close to home, increasing the appeal of some later self-extinction, a far preferable denouement than the gradual withering and atrophy that time assures.  As such, I rapidly flipped through the chapters dwelling on Jacob's painful, senescent existence.  On balance, I horoughly enjoyed learning so much about circus life in America some 100 years ago and all of the characters and plots of WFL.  Brava, Sara Guen.  Ms. Guen is a Canadian, who now resides in America with her husband and sons.  Yes, it IS worth your time.  4 Stars  BookAWeekMan [...]
5 I have seen this book on the best seller list for a long time now.  I would read the reviews here on amazon, pick it up in the bookstore only to put it down again, thinking this just isn't my type of book.  A few weeks ago I was talking with a collegue about recent books we have read.  She told me she just finished Water for Elephants.  Usually we like the same sort of books, so I had to ask her what she thought, I told her I just never bought it because it seemed so not interesting.  She encouraged me to read it, she said it was wonderful.Well, she was right!  It was amazing.  It read like a true story, and I am sure the author did her research. This book really made you feel for the main character, in current time and his past with the circus. It was sad at times, but also funny and thoughtful.  I read it in less than a week and it was one of those books that although you coudn't wait to see what happened, you didn't want it to end.
4 Water for Elephants is an entertaining read that chronicles the life of Jacob, a circus' veterinarian (well, would have been if he would have taken his final exams). The story is told in alternating time periods, Jacob recounting his youth from the confines of an assisted living facility. After the horrific death of his parents during the Great Depression, Jacob drops out of school and begins working with the Benzini Brothers circus. He quickly discovers the dark secrets so well-hidden behind the cheerful, humorous faade of circus shows. While on the road Jacob grows up and learns a great deal about life "out in the real world" while traveling with the circus, including lessons on friendship, trust, love and self-reliance.This novel is extremely plot driven and is not a literary challenge by any means. I appreciate the take on circus life; this isn't something that is commonly written about. It was still very enjoyable and interesting, and I would recommend it for all readers.
5 Loved every bit of this book. The narration is well-planned...we follow Jacob Jankowsi, a would-be vet with his father until his parents are killed in a car crash. Jacob hits the road, and one night jumps on a train. Little does he know that that one jump will change his life forever--for the better and the worst.Gruen delights readers with circus life during the depression, with strong character development and a strong plot. You root for the animals, who are heinously mistreated by the ringmaster, and you root for the workers.
5 One of the best books I've ever read.  The writing was so beautiful and lyrical.  Great surprise ending.  I'm a voracious reader, but it's been a long time since I picked up a book and didn't set it back down until I turned the last page.  Loved the "old guy".
4 I was pleasantly surprised by this story.  Granted, it had wonderful reviews here on Amazon, but there have been other popular fiction novels with the same reviews, and I loathed those books.I don't need to go into any details as the book has been so thoroughly reviewed, but I will say there was so much in the book that touched me.  Ninety or ninety-three year old Jacob's story was so emotional...it's going to stay with me for quite awhile.  Bravo!
4 Water for Elephants is the first adult novel I've read and it certainly didn't disappoint.The story starts off with ninety-three year old Jacob Jankowski recounting his life as a young man training at Cornell to be a veterinarian. He drops everything when his parents die and joins the circus.Jacob was a very easily liked character. I'd have to say the flash forwards were something I really enjoyed. Gruen's seamless writing between past and present is breathtaking. Reading the difference between an older Jacob as opposed to a young one was really intriguing. It was interesting to hear him describe how his body has aged from the vital, handsome young man he once was and how he sees himself as this decrepit old man now. It was so sad but quite hysterical at the same time.I didn't feel like I connected with Marlena too much. Yes, I liked her as a character, but I had a hard time seeing what Jacob thought was so special about her. A character I had a hard time deciding whether or not I liked, from the moment he was introduced, was August. In the beginning you want to like him when he's befriending Jacob, but when he starts slipping up and showing that he is really a very cruel man you immediately switch to despising him.Now Rosie... what can I say about Rosie? She is the cutest elephant ever! I love how Gruen wrote her with such a loveable personality. Well, really how she wrote most of the animals with such great characteristics. Bobo the monkey was also super adorable. Needless to say, something that I had a hard time with while reading this was the animal cruelty. A while back, I read an article from PETA on how elephants - most circus animals, really - are treated and it was just awful. So it was really hard reading it in gruesome detail. But hopefully, it'll make people realize how circus animals are treated so they can make a stand against it.Overall, Gruen has created a beautifully written novel. Her vivid descriptions and accurate portrayal of life in the circus during the Depression were captivating. Not once did I feel that the story dragged on and the ending left me satisfied. I also felt that the pictures of the circus at the beginning of the chapters were a nice touch.I can't wait to see if I love the movie as much as I loved the book. Rob better not disappoint! ;)
5 Water for Elephants has recently taken over the spot of my favorite book. The book flawlessly alternates between the main character's present day experience in a nursing home and his memories of his life during his early 20's. I was skeptical about the switching at first since many books that do this are usually confusing and I have to keep turning back a few pages to see what time period I'm in, but the author does this perfectly.I completely fell in love with the main character, both the 92 year old and 23 year old versions of him. As someone who works in a nursing home, his experiences were so realistic and the author captured this perfectly.The book was extremely well written and it was obvious that Gruen did her research. I found myself looking for more information about travelling circuses and downloading pictures from them, especially elephants, after reading this.
5 I usually read romance or paranormal books but I got a gift cert. for $10 for itunes and this book was like $5 for an audiobook so I got it and I must admit that I really wasn't expecting to like this book but after I started it I stayed up all night and lessened to the whole 12 hours of it. I must admit that had I been reading the book I would have got bored with it because it does describe every nook and cranny in great detail but since it was an audiobook IT WAS AWESOME! there are two men reading the book a young guy and an older entailment which brought the story to life so I felt like I was there living the life of a circus vet. and an old man in a nursing home feeling left out and worthless who gained the power to.... uh well I best let you read the book for yourself instead of giving it away. It is one of the best reads I have ever heard!  :D I would worn that there is some language and some content that you might not want your young kids to hear or read and if you get offended at cussing and "impure" thoughts you might want to skip this one but I think most would over look those minor scenes.
5 I was fortunate enough to first listen to this story as an audio book. If you get the chance, I'd recommend you hear the audio book as hearing the main character in the voice of a young man and as an elderly male, added to the pleasure of discovering this circus love story. Because I was so impressed by the audio book i purchased the eBook so I could enjoy it all again on my Kindle. This one is a classic, in my opinion.
5 I have never read a book remotley like this. It has everything that I do not read. But I got curious cause everyone kept talking about it. Glad I did. It pulled me in from the first click. I grew to love everything about this book. Felt anger at the injustice. Cried at the joy. If you are curious if something so diffrent can draw you in. Don't be. This one is a keeper that I will read SEVERAL times. And always find something new.
4 I knew from the very first chapter that I was going to be swept away by this one. In fact, it was hard to put it down, especially the last hundred pages or so. I stayed up well past my bedtime last night to finish; I just couldn't go to sleep until I knew how everything was going to work out. The characters really touched me. I was rooting for them throughout... Definitely recommend picking this one up! A total treat!
4 I read this books years ago when it came out and thought it was good, but not great.  I reread it as a book club selection and liked it much better due to the depth of characters.  The author has done her research in the life of the circus performers.  I hated the cruelty shown to some of the animals, but I know some of those things took place.  True love wins with the risks people are willing to take to be with their "soul mate".  The end is pretty unbelievable with an old man running away to join the circus (again).  However, it made me hopeful that this ignored man would find happiness in his last years.
4 Water for elephants is a good read. It captures the reader's imagination and I found myself really caring about the characters. The author has smoothly incorporated detailed information about the workings of the circus society, creating a bird's eye view of a unique community.
5 The Benzini Brothers were a third rate circus during the bottom of the Great Depression. As 90 year old Jacob now remembers it, the circus transformed the life of Marlena and himself through the power of love and trust in this heartrending story of freaks, clowns, pain and passion.  Sure to be a selection for bookclubs everywhere
3 I wish that I could say that I was one of the readers of  Water For Elephants, the well researched novel by Sara Gruen, who was graciously transported to the circus world of the 1930's, but sadly I can't.I am not one who acclaims the romance of  the beautiful Marlena, the circus horse rider and Jacob, whose personal tragedy causes him to walk away from his final exams at Cornell Vet school.  Instead, I am left thinking that perhaps, I should have read Twilight instead.  The an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists, is that it takes the heart out of the book.Though there was enough in the side characters, animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there I often found Gruen's phrasing annoying and clunky.  I have decided in all fairness to Ms Gruen and her many fans that I will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily.
5 I'm pretty sure that no matter what I say I about this book, my words won't be able to do it justice.  It's an incredible book; brilliant, educational [to an extent] and highly entertaining.  By page ten I was hopelessly lost in its story, and fought sleep to stay awake and finish it.The story is told from the view point of a man named Jacob.  His viewpoint alternates between present time, where he is an elderly man in his 90's, in an assisted living facility which he despises, and also from the past perspective, as he recalls his days as part of a train circus in the 1930's.  When young Jacob's life turns upside down, he jumps a train, not realizing which particular train he jumped--and his world is changed forever.The story has a bit of everything; history, romance, animals, mental illness, corruption...its all in there, and its all in there in a way which leaves you incapable of putting the book down.  I learned a lot of things I didn't know before reading this book.  The intelligence of elephants is far higher than I ever gave them credit for.  I learned about the epidemic of "Jake Leg," which afflicted thousands of lower class folks in the 1930's.  Not to mention how much I learned about the inner working of the train circus industry.At the end of the story is a note from the author, which for that alone the book is worth reading.  Sara Gruen is very insightful and passionate, and I have a great deal of respect for her as a person and an author now.My words aren't doing this story any justice.  There's so much to it.  It's a complex work of historical fiction, and its one I hope you all read.
5 Jacob Jankowski is pushing 90 and wallowing in a nursing home, abandoned by his family and surrounded by aged octogenarians who irk him with their senility. He has few pleasures in life --- an astute and friendly nurse named Rosemary and his vibrant memories. As Jacob lies in his bed, drifting in and out of sleep, lucidness and dreams, the compelling story of his experiences as a young man unfolds in Sara Gruen's mesmerizing new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.The year is 1932. Jacob is 23 and just shy of getting his degree in veterinary medicine from Cornell when he learns that his parents have been killed in a horrific accident. Emotionally and monetarily stranded, unmoored and with nothing to lose, Jacob jumps a train and finds himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Starting at the bottom rung of the strict caste system within the ranks of the Circus employees, Jacob's veterinary knowledge quickly garners him a place near the top of the hierarchy, among the company of the hot-headed ringmaster August and his beautiful wife Marlena --- the all-purpose female star of the show.He also finds himself among the company of cantankerous midgets, gloriously endowed "men's entertainers" and a menagerie of exotic and soulful creatures. In her previous novels, Gruen has proven herself a master at depicting the uncanny and often astounding bond between humans and animals, and the scenes with Jacob and the creatures under his care are nuanced and lovely. Gruen paints each creature's persona with as much care and detail as she does for the humans, subtly illuminating the similarities and undermining the concept of human superiority. In the Depression-era setting of Jacob's tale, the survival of the humans is inextricably intertwined with that of the animals; they all live in a kind of chaotically symbiotic state where a star horse's sickness could spell bankruptcy and the chance for redemption lies in the acquisition of an elephant named Rosie.Exceptionally drawn as well is the development of a tentative bond between Jacob and Marlena. Jacob immediately is attracted to the lovely Marlena. She takes longer to reciprocate his affection, and throughout their cautious and hesitant budding romance the presence of Marlena's husband looms large and threatening. Gruen's pacing is excellent and the tension among Marlena, Jacob and August simmers and crackles before coming to a brutal and electrifying climax.The transitions back and forth in time, and the mundane events that unfold as Jacob moans and gripes through his days at the nursing home, could have been, in the hands of a less skilled writer, jarring and distracting, breaking the flow and drawing the reader out of the story. But while the crazed, dramatic and often spectacularly bizarre world of the Benzini Brothers is fascinating, as the novel progresses the reader becomes equally drawn into Jacob's present world. His disdain for his aged body and regret over the confusing array of relatives who visit him intermittently and whose names are permanently muddied in his mind is deeply poignant.Gruen spent years researching Depression-era circuses, and the breadth of her knowledge is revealed in all the tiny details that pepper Jacob's memories, but she also has a finely-tuned radar for the magic and mysteries of the human heart. The meat and madness of this novel may appear to lie in Jacob's memories of his younger self, but in her subtle exploration of Jacob as an old man, Gruen finds an equally compelling story.Readers may find themselves churning through this book at a rapid-fire pace, eager to see what lies ahead, then slowing down as they realize the pages are dwindling. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a book that can be read and reread, recommended and handed off between friends; it begs to be discussed and mulled over. With lines of startling beauty, haunting and evocative scenes and finely-drawn characters who dance off the page, readers can dip in and out of the novel, immersing themselves in Jacob's memories. The story and its characters will haunt readers long after they have resurfaced.--- Reviewed by Jennifer Krieger
5 From the very start, this book had me completely drawn - I felt immediate compassion for the main character, the author really made me think about what it means to become old and "useless" in our society. I couldn't put this book down, the story unfolded at just the right pace, and the characters were very real and alive to me. After buying a few "duds" recently (including Last Night in Twisted River- how dull and poorly written for such a supposedly acclaimed author that one was) I was so refreshed to read a book that made me lose myself in the story.There are scenes that are very hard to read as an animal lover, but the characters you are meant to identify with are good people, trying to do the right thing. I don't like circuses at all because of all the animal abuse, so I almost didn't buy this book - but glad I did!
5 Gosh, how I cried while reading this book! It's such a beautiful and unforgettable story in so many ways, I don't even know where to begin explaining what an absolutely gorgeous must-read this is.The story is told with two voices. It starts with Jacob, a full ninety or ninety and three years old (he can't quite remember), coming to terms with aging and being left on his own by his children, in a facility for the aged; whilst looking back at his time as a drop-out veterinary student when he joined the circus after his parents death. The second voice is of Jacob during the three months he had joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931, and follows the story of him and Rosie the elephant; and him falling irrevocably in love with another man's wife - a love triangle with a difference, for sure. Both these story lines, Jacob as an old man and twenty three year old Jacob, deals with different sides and facets of Jacob.Sarah Gruen is a master character developer. Main and secondary role players were vividly painted as multi-dimensional characters. She wrote them in such a striking way that before you can stop yourself, you've lost your heart to quite a few of them, including the animals. Rosie, of course, is the star in this book and if nothing else, her trials and tribulations as well as her spectacular sense of humor, had me laughing and wiping tears at the same time.If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book yet, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. As great as the movie was, the book touched me on so many more levels than I could've imagined. I was riveted by the author's writing and the skilful manner in which she pulled me into Jacob's reality. I experienced so many emotions along with the various characters, and at times felt I could strangle August for what he put Rosie, Marlena and Jacob through.Most memorable line which made me smile: "Not only am I unemployed and homeless, but I also have a pregnant woman, bereaved dog, elephant, and eleven horses to take care of."The well-executed, fast-paced plot - fraught with twists and turns - also had moments of humor woven into it, and I finished this book feeling breathless from the anticipation, excitement and sheer excellence of this imaginative story and its realistically-sketched characters. It was clear to me that the author did in-depth research for this novel. If you don't purchase the book, at least watch the movie. But "Water for Elephant" definitely makes my list of top ten most memorable books that must be read in one's lifetime. Sara Gruen now has another proud new fan!
5 I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and was greatly surprised that I enjoyed it so much.  It is a story filled with such sad moments but also the promise of a happy future.  It is told in a wonderful way.  I enjoyed the whole ride from beginning to end.  There was some moments when I just wanted him to leave the damn circus already but do what exactly?  or go work where?  you realize how bad the economy was and at least here he was eating every day which might not have been the case anywhere else.
5 I decided to read this because of all the talk and was woried it would flop, I never should of worried. This is a wonderful novel full of plot and charactors that are a joy to meet. Definitly worth a read,  might even read it again.
5 Loved this as much as I liked the Notebook-maybe more! Kept my attention the whole time.  Has some humor and an interesting circus story as well.  The romance...well you'll just have to read that for yourself!
5 Sara Gruen's writing is hypnotic. The story is truly one of the best. It's perfect, tender, and rich. The author admirably convey the leading character's life in a full circle. The story will remain with you. I look forward on reading this novel again and again. I would very highly recommend it.
4 The book offered a glimpse into a past lifestyle and I found it interesting.  Perhaps a little silly and could have included more history but all in all I enjoyed it.
5 I haven't been this engrossed in a book in quite some time.  I couldn't stop reading it!  The story was unique and interesting, and the characters were wonderful.  I loved the old man that narrated the story. The book spoke with great honesty about getting old. Read it, you won't be disappointed!
5 In a story spanning seventy years,  Water for Elephants starts in depression-era America as a young veterinary student named Jacob Jankowski who runs from tragic circumstances, joins a circus, and then reflects on his memories at the end of his life while in a home for the aged. This book is rich in themes. It is a story about coming of age, circus life, elephants, love, friendships, cruelty, mental illness, dignity, life in an old folks home, and old age itself. Author Sara Gruen has created a world of vivid characters and scenes centering on a traveling circus. Life in this environment can be harsh and cruel, but it also has a glamorous side and a close-knit community in which decency sometimes prevails. The reader will feel the chill of despair and revulsion, but also the emotions that warm one's heart. So much goes on in Water for Elephants that I will not begin to describe the plot or all the characters. Everything is unforgettable and I find myself wondering what happened where the story left off because there is a lot more to tell. I doubt Gruen will write a sequel, but I will eagerly await one if she does.
5 I found the book so interessting right from the beginning to the end. It starts outwith a death and it keeps you wondering how it all is going to end. To have an insidechance to see how circus people lived and how they cared for the animals gives you thatchance to 'run away with the circus'
3 Water for Elephants is the story of Jacob Jankowski.  After a tragic accident involving his parents, Jacob feels lost and unsure of his future.  One night he hops a train - only to find that he's hopped a circus train.  Because he is "almost" a vetrenarian they welcome him aboard (although not that nicely or easily) and he quickly becomes embroiled in a very predictable love triangle.Gruen does a great job with the transition from the ruminations of 93 year-old Jacob in the nursing home to 22 year-old Jacob on the traveling circus.  They're seemless and very well done.  Reading about the circus and life on a traveling circus during the depression era was also interesting.My complaint with the novel lies in the fact that as a reader I felt the author just skimmed the surface with this novel.  The story was predictable and shallow, and while the characters were decently developed, the overall story line just wasn't that great, IMHO.I was disappointed.
4 This is such a nice book.  I truely recommend it. You can't put it down after you start reading.
2 I actually bought this book years ago, but just got around to reading it when I saw that the movie was out. I had high expectations because of the press from the movie and from the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, few of my expectations were met.What I Like About This Book:It's the Circus. I love the sideshow era and just to read a book that was set in a Circus was entertaining.Easy read. Ending was fun, even if it was a little too neat.What I Did Not Like About This Book:Poor character development, especially the villains. It was obvious everyone hated August and Uncle Al, but not obvious why. Even when we finally see August at his worst, its too little too late. In fact, August loses his mind because he thinks his wife is sleeping with Jake, something that is not quite true yet, but definitely headed that direction. His actions are unjustified, but his anger seems entirely justified - his wife is already having an emotional affair with another man, and has already kissed him. The villains were never developed and because of that, the story was not nearly as engaging or suspenseful as it could have been. The hero also makes some odd decisions that don't match up with his character, like letting August beat the animals.True Love? Nope. Love story seemed contrived. Falls in love at first sight.Rosie the elephant was poorly developed as a character. Almost a background piece in the story.I really can't pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that didn't work, but it definitely didn't. The characters were poorly developed, the love interest and suspense contrived, and it was hard to care a lot about the elephant because we never really got to know her. It's a shame, because I love the idea, but it just did not cut it.If you want to read some great non-fiction about sideshows and entertaining attractions, check out Ricky Jay's books.

3 It took me a good 4 days to get halfway through this book before it finally caught my attention. It was okay, I wasnt drawn in immediately. If it wasnt for the old man perspective I would have completely disliked this book.
5 One of the best books I have ever read. I absolutely loved it, the ending was so perfect I cried!
4 I enjoyed this book very much.  Full of detail and things I would have never suspected or imagined about a circus.  I must admit that I had some trouble with the scenes of animal (and even people) abuse but was able to skim quickly over it enough to get the picture but not dwell on it.  I know that this part of the book had to be told because I'm sure that it happened.  I did enjoy the animals (and people) revenge at the end greatly!  I especially loved the weaving of Jacob's story from old man to young and back again.  And of course the happy ending...well who could have asked for a better one.  Yep!  I loved this book.
3 This book had its moments, I cried and I smiled.  However there was a lot in between those moments that I ended up just glossing over.  I find that the book is normally better than the movie so I'm glad I read the book instead of watching the movie.  I don't think I could have sat for the whole movie.
2 I didn't see the movie and after reading the book, I wonder how it became a movie.I though it was a ver slow read, just didn't capture my interest enough....Not much if a storyline.
5 My title for my book review is lifted from the editorial reviews, Valerie Ryan really nailed it for me.There are so many things to like about this book.  The very best thing is the firm grounding in historical fact.  This is what it was like in America during the Great Depression, this is why the travelling circus roustabouts worked and lived the way they did, because of the Depression.  They didn't always get paid but at least they ate.  Sara Gruen handles her historical data with an exceedingly light touch, she is a marvellous storyteller.  Memorable book, very engaging. I can understand why there are nearly four thousand reader reviews.
5 Uplifting happy story.  Will leave you feeling satisfied and wanting to enjoy the life you have as much as possible.  This has a female author, but don't worry guys... it's not a chick book.  I have loaned this book to all of my good friends and they have all enjoyed it immensely as well.  Read this book.  You will not be disappointed.
4 This is an excellent, well researched book.  The author obviously has a lot of empathy with the animals.  Descriptions of life on the circus train seemed genuine.  The ending that involved the elephant was a real surprise.  One criticisim I have is that all of Sara Gruen's books have happy endings.  I guess I'm just a Jude The Obscure kind of guy.
4 "I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other." So begins Sara Gruen's near love letter to the circus, and it's inhabitants. Told in flashbacks by the eldery Jacob Jankowski, it's how he came to work as the vet for the Benzini Brothers, a second rate Barnum and Bailey, traveling across the country. A cast of ragtag characters bring the bigtop to life including a little person named Walter, the sadistic ring master August, and his beautiful performer wife Marlena who Jacob desperately longs for.This would make a fanatastic movie if it isn't already in progress. It has all the elements, from melancholy sentiment, to sweeping romance, and the allure of the magical world of the three rings.
4 This book was just what I expected. Just as I thought it would be, amazing!! This author never disappoints!! I'm actually glad I read the book first before I seen the movie. The book is so descriptive, rich, and told the story perfectly. I am also extremely happy that I found this little gem of a book to read1929 (Book One)I just couldn't put it down, took me far far an away. absolutely loved it.
5 A captivating story about a lesser known part of American history. So unique. I couldn't put it down. A real page turner
3 Have to say I'm wondering what all the fuss is about this book? Up to about page 190 I found it to be an enjoyable read and had mentioned it to friends. Alas from page 190 onwards I found it losing its grip...maybe it's too long?Most of the characters are underdeveloped to the point that much of the conversation between Jacob and the various circus folks could essentially take place between him and one other - they all sound the same. I've read peoples comments about the trials and tribulations of the characters living through the depression - it doesn't come anywhere close to a classic dealing with the same period, The Grapes of Wrath.The stampede at the end is a tad too contrived, surely the animals would be tearing themselves, and all around them, limb from limb given that they've attacked their handlers in the past. Same goes with Jacobs disappearance from the old peoples home - again too contrived.There is the makings of a great story here but I don't think Gruen is the one to tell it. The opening scenes have Blackie under the authority of Camel and then 3 months down the road Blackie is ejecting Camel from the train? Sorry it doesn't seem credible. August seems like a nasty piece of work but his paranoia was certainly well founded in the end; we're told that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia but does anyone help him out with it? Just seems a convenient way for Gruen to add a villain in to the mix...and I have to question would circus folks even know what it was in the first place, and surely his wife would have helped him try and figure it out..."I left my husband"..."why?"..."he was a paranoid schizophrenic"..."ah, OK, cool"...isn't life a little more complicated than that? And his ultimate demise and how it was conducted is a little far fetched.I guess I'm feeling let down - the book starts off well but alas doesn't maintain the quality. Also found the interview with Gruen to impart nothing of much substance and the "Questions for Book Groups" to be of a nature beyond the level of this book - Grapes of Wrath certainly gives rise to concerns about the depression, compassion etc. but this book doesn't. Alas it didn't deliver and I don't think I'll be reading anything else by Gruen based on this.Have to say that I'm a little disgruntled at the thought of Gruen has a couple of dollars of mine and undeservedly so; if I was Gruen I'd be asking myself whether the ending was worthy of the potential shown earlier in the book. Unfortunately, it's books like this that have me buying books secondhand, and for the most part reading the "classics"; they're classics as they've withstood the test of time - I can't imagine this book doing so. For authors I like I'm more than happy to buy a book new and in the process pay money to the author, but my disappointment with this book is such that I don't think Gruen deserves any reward for it and makes me realise what a financial risk one is making buying new books from untried authors.Why are there so few contemporary authors out there who are deserving of the praise that seems to be lauded upon them so easily these days? For those of you looking for a book that covers the darker aspects of humanity and their situations along with some wonderfully humourous moments then give "Suttree" a read by Cormac McCarthy - it's not the easiest of reads but rewards effort.
4 In the great depression, a young man drops out of Veterinary school and joins a travelling circus. The story unfolds in flashbacks from his present day existence in a nursing home. The author takes us into a world of cruelty, privation and danger, which is nevertheless full of adventure and the possibility of love. The story grabs you quickly. I couldn't put this one down. I told my friends about it, and the ones who actually started it were hooked too!The writer creates believable characters, and I found myself caring about them. Perhaps some were larger than life, but it helped the story. Was the circus really this grim and dangerous in the 1930's? I do not know, but Sara Gruen makes it entirely believable.This book occupied all of my spare time for several days, and that is just what I hope for when I pick up a new one. The ending was a little bit contrived, but I have forgiven authors for much worse. Get your hands on this one; you won't be sorry.
5 It's one of those rare books that is impossible to put down but after it's over, you feel like you learned a lot.I'm going to give away as little as possible about the storyline because I don't want to ruin anything, so I'll just give you a little background information. It is about the traveling circus back in the Great Depression Era and offers you a glimpse of a fantasy life that you'd never imagine on your own. She did tons and tons of research on circuses back then so everything is extremely realistic and she covers topics that have always interested me (like prohibition, speakeasies, and the intelligence of animals). To make the book even more relevant to readers today, she weaves the past in with the present to create a masterful story that you'll remember for years to come.A lot of times, after I finish reading a book I'll forget how it ended in just a few months... not in this case though, the ending gave me goosebumps and I'll always remember it vividly.
5 I haven't read novels in many many years and I decided to pick this up at Target. I had no idea it was going to be a movie. I have to say it was incredibly engrossing, and so much fun to be a part of this other world of train circuses! This is a short review, others have said it better. I'll just say, don't hesitate. Just get it!
5 Excellent reading
5 I had planned on watching the movie first because it looked good and  I can't usually watch a movie and enjoy it if I read and enjoyed the book first and vis versa. However, the book got better reviews than the movie and I didn't want to taint my experience with the story, so I picked up the book first and I'm glad I did.We are deliver the story through Mr. Jacob Jankowsky's ninety, or ninety-three year old memory. He can't remember his age but he remembers his life with the train traveling circus in the 1930's like it was yesterday. We see the excitement of a life as a circus worker and more often then not the dangers that the job presents, especially if you start to fall for the crazy jealous circus trainer's wife.
2 I was really disappointed by this book. The only parts that were not too bad were the chapters where Jacob was an old man. But the circus stuff was very pedestrian. No spark to the writing. Don't waste your time.
4 It took me a long time to get into this book.  It is a little pornographic in parts.  But it ended up being good.  I loved the ending.  I can't wait until the movie comes out!
5 Great book! I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend to others. Different setting which makes it interesting. Check this book out. You won't regret it.
5 I fell in love with this book several years ago. After hearing it was going to be a movie, I was VERRRRRRY excited.I re-read the book a few days before the movie came out, just to familiarize myself with the characters and events and again, for the second time fell in love with Jacob & Rosie.  I love the setting, Jacob's flashbacks and the language barrier with Rosie. Definitely worth the few dollars it costs.
5 Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski, and almost-veterinarian whose life has just fallen apart. As he comes to this realization, Jacob stumbles upon the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus train and hops aboard. He quickly secures his place on the show as the menagerie vet, a position that will change his life forever.Sara Gruen weaves an incredibly realistic tale that allows the reader a rare glimpse into the prohibition era circus lifestyle. The amount of tension throughout the book is always palatable. I often found myself clenching my jaw and holding my breath by the end of a chapter. August is a particularly well-developed character, frightening in the most realistic and entirely plausible way. There is a sense of impending destruction and collapse that builds with each paragraph.This tension is gracefully relieved every few chapters by visiting Jacob, age ninety (or ninety-three), in his current state as a resident at an assisted living facility. Through the telling of Jacob's present story, the reader reaches another level of understanding and can comprehend the meaning of Jacob's earlier experiences in entirely new ways. The tale would be much less satisfying without this continuation of the story, however small it may seem.An issue that must be addressed when talking about Water for Elephants is the treatment of animals. Some scenes in the book are very difficult to read, but it's worth reading through. You will fall in love with so many of the animals as though they're human, and you will be satisfied with their redemption.For me, Water for Elephants receives 5/5 stars. I consider it a "must read" that will forever change the way you think. It's the type of story that won't soon leave your mind.
5 Enjoyable, easy reading,  I look forward now to seeing the movie,  I loved the unexpected ending!  Well written story. Good.
5 I have owned this book for a few months. I keep getting side tracked by other books so I did not read it. Last week so many people told me how wonderful the book was and even the movie. SO, I picked it up last night and am almost done with it. WOW!!! What a wonderful story. You can tell a lot of research went into this by the accuracy. While I know very little about circus life I do work with the elderly and that is all accurate. A lot on the lines of "The Notebook" the way the story in told.
5 An enchanting story, and not just because of the "Big Top Magic" that the circus brings.  A wonderful read.
4 Sara Gruen did a fantastic job of recreating the circus life in the 1930's as well as presenting us with the daily struggles of living of a contemporary man in his 90's who lives in a nursing home.  This man is the main protagonist of the novel, who recounts his story from his last days in vet school whose life trajectory takes him to the circus after a tragic incident.  The novel is rich with visual imagery of circus life - the animals, the workers, the performers, the props, the train travel etc - and as rich with the depressing conditions of a nanogenarian living in a nursing home - the daily struggles to handle basic life skills, relationships with the staff and other residents, and, saddest of all, the knowledge of the sense of loss of one's memory, and with that, the eventual loss of connection to relatives.  The narrative moves quickly and aggressively, taking the reader back and forth between the circus and the nursing home, with each venue progressing dramatically towards its conclusion.  The main charcater, Jacob, is sympathetic, and you root for him all the way, accompanying him along his travails of adjustment to circus life and his love interest.  You get wrapped up in the drama and stay along eagerly on the ride.Here are my minor objections(The first is directed at author and editor.):  In a span of two pages the author uses the exact same phrase regarding some anticipated emotion from different characters.  It's jarring to read, and you go back to see if you misread it - but no.  Not a big deal but it interrupted the flow.  Bad enough, but the same phrase (or almost the exact same phrase) appears again near the end of the book about the same emotion, and, once again, I'm jarred and lose the focus of the story.  It seems like an amateurish mistake by author or editor.The other problem I had was that, at times, some of the circus characters were borderline stereoptypical/cartoonish, as if the protagonist is one of a few only real people.  Finally, the concluding chapter had some elements to it of a Hollywood happy ending, with an implausible change of attention from tragedy to negotiation.
5 I saw the movie before reading the book.. I taken enjoyed finding the similarities and the differences between the two.  I honestly can't say which I enjoyed better, but if you like one you will definitely be at least pleased with the other!
5 I resisted this book for a long time but I'm so glad I finally picked it up. I'm very sad it's over. I can't wait to read more from Sara Gruen.
5 Page after page this novel is filled with interesting facts, experiences and history. That it's a memoir of a patient/resident of a nursing home is a literary vehicle of genius. How remarkable to live the life of a this young man, one we can easily identify with, through this period of American history (30's, 40's) only to end up with him in a current-day nursing home, the finest of which are lonely places indeed.My wife and I just recently visited an uncle who lived in a very fine nursing home in another state and were pronounced "saints" by the staff who said no one ever visits these people. That's why I'm haunted by the ending of this book.I've also paid more attention to stories of the intelligence of elephants, their almost human sense of justice. Perhaps I mean their more-than-human sense of justice.A wonderful book. You will be glad you read it.
5 The archetypical American novel features a solitary protagonist undertaking an odyssey in which he/she confronts both physical and moral challenges and through which he/she emerges with a renewed spirit, transformed by the crucible of confrontations with adversaries, both real and imagined.  Sara Gruen's engaging "Water for Elephants" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life.  Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero.  "Water for Elephants" is a triumph  --  of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.The innocent Jacob, on the threshold of graduating from Cornell veterinary school and returning to the Midwest to practice medicine with his father, is shattered by the sudden accidental deaths of his parents.  Unmoored from his past and unable to focus on his final examination, he abandons his former life the moment he jumps on board a passing train.  To his astonishment, he has leaped into the midst of a traveling circus, and, thanks to the flinty care of several roustabouts, manages to gain employment with the tawdry Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus dominated by a sadistic ringmaster and populated by a cast of characters, admirable and evil in equal proportions.  In a manner of weeks, Jacob immerses himself as the circus "vet," forms abiding friendships, falls is love and faces moral dilemmas that tie his conscience into Gordian knots.Some critics have likened Jacob to his biblical counterpart and praised the novel for its allusions to the Bible.  In my opinion, Jacob mirrors a less sanctified model, Huckleberry Finn.  Like Huck, Jacob flees familiar surroundings, flaunts social norms, befriends outcasts and risks his personal safety in order to adhere to a hard-earned sense of conscience and social responsibility.  Both Huck and Jacob confront mendacious adversaries, rejoice in life on the lam and re-invent themselves.  Like Twain, Sarah Gruen writes with inordinate respect about the dispossessed and with painful awareness about the inexplicable capacity for the human heart to do well in the midst of spiritual darkness.  As Twain has written  --  and as Gruen affirms  --  the source of humor is pain.Even the title bespeaks our capacity for misrepresentation.  The elderly Jacob, shunted away by his family in a assisted-living nursing home, excoriates a new resident who has claimed to have carried water in buckets for elephants when he was a youngster.  Aware of an elephant's enormous drinking capacity, Jacob knows a lie when he hears one.  And well he should.  The entire purpose of the traveling circus is deception, an enterprise where rubes are separated from their money by gaping at mangy animals, staring at sideshow freaks (many of whom are frauds) or being serviced by "exotic dancers."  Falsehoods, illusions and duplicity are the moral big tent under which circus performers enchant Depression men and women hungry for escape.  The central conflict of the novel rotates around Jacob's involvement with a married woman and the peculiarly disturbing aspects of her husband's mental state.  This conflict is rife with secrecy, duplicity and tormented twisting of ideas of right and wrong.It is no surprise that this novel is a best-seller.  Written with extraordinary narrative drive, populated by characters who truly represent our national character and animated by a young man whose journey for self-discovery is our own, "Water for Elephants" intimately involves us in Jacob Jankowski's search for meaning.
5 Water for Elephants offers some thing for everyone.  If you're a pragmatist you will love the research and facts concerning the circus of the depression era.  If a romantic, the ending will be for you. If you are young, the choices and frustrations suffered by Jacob will be yours. For me, a senior citizen, the gerentology  added greatly to the story.I thought it a great read especially since there are 70 years between the youth and aged of the story which is told in flashback form. There is little in common between the two periods of time except for love and the anticipation of all ages.Try it, you will like it.
5 Amazing book which brings us into the life of a student at Cornell whose life changes dramatically and rapidly within a few days - and, as with all persons, those dramatic changes influence the rest of his life.  The story is of a circus worker during the depression...and it brought back some vague memories of my early childhood, watching a small circus roll into town, watching the elephants parade through from the train depot and to a farmer's field where the "Big Top" would suddenly sprout with flags a-flying.  The story is told from the view of the worker who's now in his 90's...and is fascinating as to how the author mixes past and present to give a picture of an amazing whole.
5 This is the type of book where you're reading and forget about the rest of the world. I felt like Alice in Wonderland, lost in another world (1930s) with colorful characters (a circus). Yes, this book is about a circus and, yes, YOU WILL LOVE IT! Definitely a "re-readable" book!
1 I really dislike everyone in this book. I'll pass on criticizing the weak writing & the obvious lack of credible research (various other one star reviews have covered that) and instead attack the characters: Jacob is a stupid d**che, Marlena is a stupid tw*t, and August is just an a-hole.Jacob is supposed to be a vet/animal caretaker but what does he do? He lets August repeatedly beat the bejeesus out of Rosie, the elephant. But as soon as Marlena, August's tw*tty wife, appears with a black eye Jacob goes bonkers and attacks August. Okay... Really?! I'm not brushing off wife-beating here, but really?! One flipping black eye and August deserves to die? I would have killed that bastard for beating AND torturing Rosie LONG BEFOREHAND!! And then Jacob keeps harping about it: "He hit her! He hit her! He hit her!" Well, so what? It's not like she was tied to a stake like Rosie was. And the only reason she had the black eye was because August thought she was having an affair with Jacob! And then the author uses "paranoid schizophrenia" to explain August's behavior? Seriously?! He's just a possessive prick! With good reason to be "paranoid," turns out, since Jacob really IS after his wife.The only main character that wasn't completely unlikable, really, was Walter aka Kinko but Jacob got him killed by being *gasp!* a stupid d**che.I'm not surprised this book is so popular, though. It's a simple, easy read with little to no thinking required.
4 Water for Elephants is loaded with interesting words because Sara Gruen owns a commanding vocabulary, and utilizes her well-chosen words with precision.  She also understands how to set the hook and carefully reel her reader in.  She's a master angler.The story is entertaining and the setting--a train circus-- is interesting.  Obviously Gruen heavy research is what birthed the rich detail.While some call this a romance book, the romance is lacking and rushed.  This is more of an action-adventure "who done it."
5 I really did not know what to expect when I picked up this book, but I am so glad that I did. It was a great story with wonderful life-like characters. In parts it is funny and sad and also shocking when you read how some of the circus workers and animals were treated. I really hated to see it end. Do yourself a favor and read it, you won't be sorry.
2 I was given this book to borrow -- "It is just a wonderful book." I cannot stand mediocre writing, and for this reason I don't often read popular fiction. I pushed into it, however, hoping for the best. Just could never care at all about the characters. The old guy is grumpy and resentful. Some of the circus behind-the-scenes reporting is interesting, but much of that is pretty low-life and tawdry. Not for me. I will read the ending and report back to my friend, but I will not read the rest of it.
4 A fun read!  I learned a lot about the circus.  Sara Gruen did an excellent job of depicting the circus experience in the early 20th century.
1 My hatred for this book knows no bounds. This is the trashiest thing to infiltrate the literature section of the bookstore since Henry Miller. (Although I'm not a Henry Miller expert, I'm guessing he at least brought some literary merit to the table, which is more than I can say for this author!) The depression-era circus setting, although intriguing, was not enough to make up for the endless vulgarity, flat characterization and vapid dialogue. And, to make matters worse, no character, at least from the ones I can remember, is spared horrific scenes of physical abuse - you name it, woman, worker, elephant, dog, clown. I just got tired of it all after a while.Why did I even bother to finish it? It was sort of like watching Ripley's Believe it or Not to see what kind of ghastly thing would happen next. Well now I believe it; this is one of the worst contemporary books I've read.
5 I honestly didn't know what to expect when I started WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, but as I continued on hour after hour, I realized what a terrific book it is!  Set in post-Depression America and the Benzini Brother's Circus, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is full of emotions and flashes of great humor. All the characters, including the animals, all have pivotal roles throughout the story. This book is a great blend of history, mystery, love story and memoir.Highly recommend with 5 stars!!!
5 WATER FOR ELEPHANTS IS A RIVETING READ REVEALING THE UGLY UNDERSIDE OF DPRESSION ERA 'TRAIN CIRCUSES.  ALONG WITH ACCOUNTS OF CRUELTY TO MAN AND BEAST ARE STORIES OF GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK, ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE TOO DISTURBING FOR SOME. I STARTED READING WITH MY GLASSES, THEN GLASSES AND A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND FINALLY WITH DOUBLE VISION BECAUSE I  COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.
4 This is one of those books you don't want to put down. A great read. I wish I could say from start to finish, but I found the ending to be very weak and not in character with the rest of the book. Even so, I would highly recommend this book.
5 Weird but still very interesting... I enjoyed this book very much.. It had a very happy ending..I wanted to finish the book as soon as I opened it
5 This is one of the most fun books I have read.  From page 1 all the way thru. I have laughed out loud at so many points and then sad at others. This is a fantastic read. I usually don't like to read women authors, Tess Gerritson and Alex Kava are the exceptions, but Sara has done a great, great job. I can hardly wait now to see the movie. I hope Sara had a lot to do with writing the movie script.  So many really good books stories are ruined when it comes to be a movie.
5 In the beginning of Water For Elephants Jacob Jankowski tells us that he is 90 or 93 (who can really be certain anymore?) His body betrayed him years ago and Jacob now fears that his mind isn't far behind. Shuffling along miserably behind his walker, he's living out his final days in the nursing home and hating every minute of it. Just another invisible senior citizen who's family and the world as a whole has forgotten about.When the circus comes to town and sets up its Big Top tents across the street Jacob comes alive and through a series of flashbacks begins to tell us his life's story. Taking us back to when he joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth, a traveling circus he toured with during the great depression.At the age of 23 Jacob had a predictable future set out ahead of him, one that certainly didn't involve joining the circus. However with his parents untimely death and the bank foreclosing on his family home Jacob soon finds himself homeless, heartbroken and mentally quite unable to sit his final veterinary exams. When an exotic, animal filled train steams toward him Jacob doesn't even think. Flinging himself aboard the boxcar and inadvertently changing his destiny forever.I absolutely adored this book, alternately falling in love with both Jacob, the crotchety old man and Jacob, the young, moral and penniless circus veterinarian. Water For Elephants transported me to another time and quickly became one of those books I never wanted to end.Author Sara Gruen has researched the depression era circus life down to the smallest of details and I feel that this captivating and vivid story will appeal to almost anyone.Filled with action, adventure and a sweet forbidden romance there is also a fascinating sideshow of secondary characters including a clever Polish Elephant, a grouchy little person as Jacob's roommate and a cruel and schizophrenic animal trainer whose wife Jacob just happens to fall in love with. All of this has been wrapped together with a compelling and innovative behind the scenes look aboard a travelling circus train. Showing us more often then not the darker side of circus life after the big top closes down. This is a love story, a life story, an animal lover's story but above all it's a circus story and who of us hasn't dreamed about running away and joining the circus at some point in our lives? And the ending... *sigh*I can't say enough good about this book, its easily one of my favourite reads this year and with Robert Pattison now taking on the upcoming movie role version of Jacob, I was able to picture him while reading, making it all the more sweeter.
3 Not going to lie, I bought this so I could read it before the movie came out (Robert Pattinson fan :-P).  While it was an easy read, I didn't love it. I found it difficult to appreciate the circus life with the description of it, but the characters were interesting.  The ending surprised me, so I loved that!  Nothing worse than a predictable novel.  There were many endearing and HUMAN situations and characters of the novel, so I found myself rooting for some characters and hating others.  Not every book I read invokes that kind of emotion in me.This story is a some-what of a page turner and (again) an easy read, but there was some kind of disconnect.  I can't quite define what was missing from this book, but I think it's worthwhile.  Would be great for a book club.
5 Water For Elephants is one of the best books I have read this year. Initially, I did not have any interest in reading this book because it involved a circus and I am not a huge fan of circuses. But at the insistence of some friends, I picked it up and began reading. Boy am I glad I did!Jacob Jankowski is a young man who is thrust mercilessly into the aftermath of the cruelties of life. Despite his circumstances, however, he is a good and honorable man and his compassion and honor shine through on every page of this book. He is a character that reader's immediately fall in love with and can relate to on some level or another. The story itself grabs you instantly and takes you back to a time where traveling circuses were the biggest events in town.Set in the 1930's, Water For Elephants offers a glimpse into a very strange and wonderous world of circus folk during a time when many, if not most, of the country was unemployed and doing anything they could to earn a buck or at least a meal. It was fascinating to read of the lifestyle of the circus workers and how they were treated, how they related to one another, how they treated their animals and what they thought of the townspeople they traveled the country to entertain.Water For Elephants is also a story that tells of the love and life of Jacob and Merlena and their love for the animals that they come to know while working with them in the circus. The book is beautifully and vividly written, the characters well developed and easy to love (or hate as the case may be) and the animals' antics, especially Rosie, will make you laugh out loud.Water For Elephants is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it!
4 I just spent the last fifteen minutes looking at the reviews ~~ and it's very interesting to read all the comments as well. There are so many varied responses to this book that the author must be in heaven to get so many responses to this book.I first heard of this book last spring when a fellow Amazon reviewer told me that I "just had to read it." I wasn't that inclined since the price was not favorable and the waiting list at the library was too long. However, in my book club, it was the November book to discuss. So when I saw it on the table at the local bookstore for buy three, get one free, I snapped it up. It is not a decision that I have regretted. It is one of the better entertaining books of fiction that I have read this year, if not one of the best. And I read a lot.There are some disaparities in this book as with others, but I think people tend to forget that a work of fiction is simply that, a work of fiction. Not everything's going to "mesh together" as in real life. That's why you read nonfiction if you like everything in its proper place and order. This book is simply a fanastic tale of a man facing the end of his life in a dreary nursing home setting, and reliving some of the best moments of his life. A young orphan who happened to jump the train to get away from the tragedy that was his life happened to be on a circus train. He didn't plan to run away to the circus, he just stumbled on the circus train while grieving. And stayed. Fell in love with the most beautiful girl in the world who is happened to be married to the ringmaster. What a story!This novel alternates between Jacob's present and past ~~ he relives the first three months of being in Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and seventy years prior, he was the Benzini Brothers' vet, taking care of the underfed animals of that show. He worked with all kinds of people and animals. It was an exciting life ~~ how many people do you know that lived a life like that? Marlena is the wife of the psychotic ringmaster who alternately abused his wife, his animals and co-workers. Rosie is the elephant bull that Uncle Al, the owner of the circus, bought for a song, hoping that Rosie will be the biggest draw to his circus.The descriptions in this novel are lavish. One can see the sawdust in the air as the big top was put up. One can see the cotton candy being spun. One can feel the humiliation of an old man having to take a shower under the watchful eye of the nurse in the nursing home. One can feel his love for the beautiful show girl. And all of this is tied together beautifully, both past and present. It is a glimpse into a life of a man.Why didn't I give it a five star? Simply because I felt that the endings to both stories were rushed. I did not expect it to have such happy endings since the stories were more gritty and realistic. But hey, this is a work of fiction, right?11-4-07
5 Since it was/has been made into a movie.  And as usual the book is always better than the movie.  But the movie does follow the book pretty well.  You just don't get the back story on everything that you do by reading the book.
5 I know that not one book is for everyone, but I honestly cannot imagine someone not loving Water For Elephants. I didn't go into it expecting to fall in love, but that's exactly what I did. The story, told through an elderly and retirement-home bound Jacob Jankowski, takes us on a journey as he recalls life on the circus. Hopping on a train, Jacob is looking for an escape from life at home where he has lost everything dear to him. He discovers that the old train is carting a circus show, and eventually gets himself a job. Along the way he falls in love with the majestic circus act, the amazing animals, and of course, the young and beautiful Marlena.I was repeatedly impressed by the great and believable depth of the characters in this book, including Marlena's ill-tempered and abusive husband, August. Jacob,the main character, stays strong and consistent throughout the entire story. I liked how he came to the rescue of all in need and didn't back down when the going got tough. His heroic acts and the fantastic tale that go along with it make this a five-star read in my book!
3 Interesting book that makes you want to keep reading, but in the end, it seems like the author tried too hard to wrap things up and make everyone happy.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House
5 Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a pleasurable book to read.  Among its many virtues, is Guren's recreation of the atmosphere of depression era America, and a unique circus subculture that existed in what now must be viewed as the lost past.  Leading this tale is a genuinely likeable guy, a rarity in contemporary literature.  This hugely popular book is without serious lessons to preach or meaning to convey.  Rather, it is a good story which provided me with many hours of pleasant diversion.
3 Water for Elephants is an interesting text because it is not especially well written, the story is pure soap opera, and yet it is an enjoyable read that at times evokes a long gone era. I think it suffers from overly effusive praise and so many readers are bitterly disappointed once they get through it.First, let's look at the strengths of the novel. I enjoyed the evocations of circus and train life. Gruen clearly spent some time working on these descriptions of circus life and there are little Depression era details that were nice historical jewels for the reader to mine. Also effective was her characterization of old Jacob. His voice was witty and biting and he provided the most pleasure of any character in the text. Chapter nineteen of the novel is the saddest depiction of rest home life I have read in literature. A man is forgotten by his family, and the scene is heartbreaking.Now to examine the reasons why this book is unsatisfying. First off the characters from the 1930s parts of the novel are some of the weakest characterizations I have seen in a book in a long time. They are stock characters at best, and the villains are the mustache twirling men from melodrama. It is hard to care about any of the characters because they are so transparently fake. Even more distracting then the weak characterization is the incredibly insipid (and modern sounding) dialogue Gruen puts in their mouths. She has such nice historical details in the setting of the text, why couldn't she also use it in the dialogue?Many readers have found the ending unsatisfying, and although it is ridiculous, it fits the novel so I won't argue with it. The cloying depiction of animals is also a little beyond the pale, but again, I simply had to come to terms with the novel for what it is. It is popular fiction. It is a melodrama you will get caught up in. And for those purposes it is adequate. Don't go into it expecting more than what it is capable of giving and you will be satisfied.
4 We find ourselves in the beginning at a nursing home with the elderly Jacob Jankowski's.  When the circus comes to town We begin to find out that Jacobs memory is still there and he takes you back to an era in the Great Depression.As a young man Jacob's life gets upended and he finds himself on a circus train.  They realize that Jacob with his training to become a vet will be of some use to the circus.  He falls victim to the ups and downs of life on the circus train and the beauty of the main act Marlena.  And falls in love with the larger than life Rosie, the Elephant.  Everything and everyone is subjected to the mercy of the cruel circus boss and Marlena's husband.This story is really engaging.  I personally found myself laughing at the antics of the circus family, cringing at the reality of the cruel act of red lighting.  And furious when the circus bosses cruelty reached horrifyingly to everyone and everything.
5 I found this book to be a very touching story with an interesting setting. The time period, the place, and the characters come to life in this wonderful story.  I don't want to give too much away but if you enjoy a book that makes you feel as though you are there...this is one!  There were times while reading this I wanted to throw a few punches, and other times I wanted to stand between August & Rosie, and times I just wanted to pat the hand of the older Jacob.  I'm sorry I finished this book...I will miss these characters.
5 If you have not yet read, Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, you won't want to miss it. It's historical fiction that takes us back to the 1st Great Depression and into the world of the circus. A fantastic read and hard to put down.Caution however...chances are after reading this phenomenal historical account of the inner-workings of the circus; you may very well NEVER attend another one. I have had to set the book down several times due to how emotionally challenging it can be.Added bonus: The Kindle edition of this book includes historical photographs of circus life reprinted with permissions from various museums. I am unsure whether this is an eBook feature only or if these pictures are also included in the printed edition. I would imagine that they are. The photos alone tell their own story.My rating? (And I am, admittedly, a book-worm and literary 'snob' that takes these rating very seriously): 5 solid stars both for historical accuracy AND phenomenal character development, plot design and writing style. I don't give ratings that high unless novels REALLY shine and this one stands out and will forever leave it's imprint on you, the reader. Happy reading!
5 This was an unexpectly good book.  There are really two stories in it and I enjoyed both completely.  I loved the end.
5 I had heard alot about this book before reading it and read so many positve comments and reviews but tried to go into it with an open mind so I could decide for myself! I was not disappointed, it was a terrific book, so well written, full of rich history. It was difficult to put down!
5 I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this book but was quickly drawn into the storyline.  As the daughter of an aging parent, I could empathize with the main character.  The story was developed well even with the flipping from the past to the current time.  At times I had a hard time putting the book down.  I had not seen the movie (but I will download it now) so the ending was a real surprise to me.  I enjoyed it immensely.
5 I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end!  I now have a new respect for Circus people and animals.  I couldn't put the book down.
5 I read this book not too long after it came out, I had borrowed it then and decided it was so good to go ahead and buy a copy for myself. I love it!! It was full of emotion and excitement. Sara Gruen is an excellent author.I just bought her other book Ape House and I can't wait to get into it
1 Life's a bitch and then you get old and it's worse and then you die.  That's all you need to know, which is a good thing because this novel has left me too depressed to write any more.
4 I just finished reading Water for Elephants and thought this book was pretty good.  I really could not put the book down!  I had to force myself to close the book because If I wanted to, I could finish it in a day.  I choose to read this book since it had such high ratings.  I'm glad I picked it up.
5 I really enjoyed this book!  I enjoyed the imagery of the circus and the settings, the historical facts of both the Great Depression and circuses during that time period, and I enjoyed learning more about circuses and the treatment of circus animals overall!There were parts that were disturbing - the mistreatment of circus animals, the mistreatment of circus employees, and the abuse of the lead woman.  But, overall, the plot was engaging and unique.  I especially enjoyed the flashback moments of the present lead character and his reminiscence of the past.  Make sure to read the Prologue! - it adds to the artistic nature of the writing style.I haven't seen the movie yet - hope it's as good as the book.
5 From August 2009:I'm still working out how I feel about this book. It was so well written, goes seamlessly between the past and the present. The love story (was it between he and Marlena or he and Rosie?) was lyrically written. The author did an amazing job of pulling me back and forth between the two. I even shed a few tears over a few different things. I'm not an animal activist, but certain parts of this book made me very uncomfortable. The history of the circus is pretty well known. We know the animals were mistreated (heck, they are today too), but the author writes so well about this subject that I found it hard to swallow that lump in my throat. It's obvious she did some major research into the subject matter.When I originally read the description for this book, it was on my "skip it" list, but a few of my friends read it and told me I "had" to read it. I'm so glad they did. This was a beautiful book and definitely in my top 10 for the year.=======================February 2010:I read this one just six months ago but someone in my book club chose it so I decided to re-read it. It's always interesting when I read a book a second time, especially if it was one that I really enjoyed (and this was definitely a book I enjoyed immensely.I noticed things I didn't notice in the first read, probably because I knew what was going to happen so I found a lot of the little quirky foreshadowing and things. The prologue, of course, caught me and a lot of "ahhh..." moments.This is a book you must read. It really is that simple. I had looked at it a few times, but it really didn't look like anything I would want to read, so I kept skipping it. A friend of mine insisted I read it last year and I'm glad she did. It's absolutely wonderful! Read it.
5 A great story from beginning to end. The information about life working for the "Big Top" is entertaining and absorbing. Drama, excitement, hardship, and a love story make this an excellent read.
4 I really enjoyed this since it is a topic you don't really read about too often,However, the last page sort of ruins it.  I mean COME ON.  It's just not plausible within the confines of the narrative.
5 This book is very enjoyable from beginning to end. It starts with a narration in the present and weaves in events from the narrators past. The style is fluid and non pretentious, engaging for its simplicity and character development. This book feels real when it presents its characters and you can't help but get entwined with the sentiments they live. I haven't seen the movie but I'm glad I read the book first. The story revolves around Jakob a retired circus vet which relates how he came to be involved in the circus world of the 30's and all he lived through while the show went on. The story depicts life through the depression, prohibition and society as a fitting background for the storyline.
5 Wow.  This book was just spectacular.  I tore through it (it grabbed me and would not let go).  How many books do you see a fifteen-year-old (my niece) reading while walking up stairs?  She could not stop reading it to climb the stairs!  It was an amazing ride.  I cannot imagine that ANYONE would not love this book.I read two of Sara Gruen's earlier books and this is in a different category - a tour de force, an absolute must-read.  What a lovely book.  You end up feeling grateful to her for writing it just so you could read it.  I cannot say enough about how great this book was - an enthralling story, enthrallingly told, absolutely marvelous.
5 I liked the story because it was different than other books I have read. The setting, characters, and plot were unique and very interesting. I liked how the story was told from both the older and younger Jacob's point of view.
4 I purchased this book reluctantly, since it didn't sound like my "cup of tea".  I mainly wanted to read it before I saw the movie, which is the order I like to do this, especially when I can see the movie and then refer back to the book to refresh my memory.  But in spite of myself, I enjoyed the book very much, and read it into the late hours last night(and early morning) because I didn't want to go to sleep until I finished it!I like the way the author goes back and forth in time; it is well done and easy to follow - sometimes this device can get confusing if not properly handled!  I'm not much of a circus person; of course I went when I was a child, then again with children and grandchildren, but I had a fear of animals that has been only partially conquered thanks to my grandson's love of them.  I have always stood in the back of crowds at Mardi Gras parades due to my major fear of horses!  But this book to me was enough about the human side as to make the circus details palatable, even interesting.I especially enjoyed the story line at the "retirement community" since I have a good friend who works at one, and I used to advertise for the place when I had a radio talk show called "Life Begins at 50".  Needless to say, I am a senior myself and without giving away too much information, I felt that the scenes there were very real.  I would highly recommend this book, especially to seniors and their families - not only for the enjoyment, but for the relationship insights therein.
4 This book reminded me of the movie, &#34;Benjamin Button&#34;.  The format of an old man looking back at his life was reminiscent of the regretful and poignant tone in the movie.The story is told by Jacob, half about his life now as a 90-year old man, forgotten by his family in a nursing home.  The other half is about Jacob's life as a young man in the circus.  Jacob runs off to join the circus, literally, when he is just about to graduate from college.  Devastated by the loss of his family and fortune, he turns to the only thing he knows and loves--the one connection he has to his veterinarian father--the animals.  Jacob gets a job 'watering the elephants', and one grouchy elephant in particular, as he works as the circus animal veterinarian.  Jacob also has the really dumb luck of falling for Marlena, a trick horse rider.  Marlena just happens to be married to the circus boss, a sadistic man who beats her and the elephants.  The whole situation is a powder keg waiting to explode.Interspersed with this is the story of present-day Jacob and his longing, so tender and sad, that pulls on the heartstrings.  It is a sweet, tragic romance.I loved the parts that explained how the traveling carnivals worked.  It was so fascinating knowing that many incidents were based on real, actual events.  A heavy book with lots of good ingredients that will leave you satisfied.
5 One of the best books I read in 2007.  Sara Gruen is a great storyteller.
5 The plot is uncomplicated, the characters are not memorable, but the setting is the key!  Depression literature has been depressing.  However, the story about how real people handled it in an unusual setting is delightful.  In addition, the details about the circus are enlightening.
5 When Jacob Jankowski's parents died in an automobile accident, he was just about to become a Veterinarian.But, with that shock, and the shock of finding out that his parents didn't leave him the financial comforts that he had thought were there, Jacob, didn't take his last college exam.  And, he wondered into the life of a circus, where he learned a great deal about the human condition and about animals.During these tough Depression Era days, he lived in filth, but the animals meant a great deal to him.  So, he applied what he had learned at Cornell University Veterinarian School, to protect the animals, and anyone who he loved.This book was a story about love, loss and finding what matters most to you, when you've loss what seemed to be all that mattered.
3 For the most part this was a moving and fascinating story. Well written, the characters were vivid and appealing, even, at times, the villains. However, I found the way the story ended to be somewhat trite and not at all believable.Although the loyalty and brotherhood among circus people was clearly portrayed throughout, the end of the story reduced this excellent portrait of a mysterious and esoteric world into a fairy-tale. For me, the lovely flight ended with a thud, from a delicious learning experience to an insult to my intelligence.
3 I had no anticipation of what to expect when I began reading Water for Elephants.  The most enlightening aspect of the story was the education I received about the hierarchy of employees within the circus.  From an outsider who has always been taught (but never believed it) that people in the circus where of lower class than others, I had no idea there were different ranks of people within the circus.  Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane.  From the beginning the book was colorful with characters.  The transitioning between the past and the present with the main character was an interesting transition.I try to approach a book with an open mind and throw other opinions out the window.  I am pleased I have done this because the people that I know who have read this book have ranged from horrible to excellent.  I found this book entertaining and engrossing. It was never a book that I just could not put down, but I enjoyed read it.  Because the era in which the reference of the circus occurred the comparison of food lines and the great depression was evident.  Although the inhumane treatment of the people and animals undoubtedly occurred during this time period, it wasn't easy to read it.  Although the hierarchy of the class of people was evident within the circus, it was not unlike how society actually was during this time period.  The author clearly did research to solidly base the sad realities of the treatment of people and animals during the depression era.The author weaved a story with vivid characters and animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light.  Sara Gruen's engaging "Water for Elephants" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life. Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero. "Water for Elephants" is a triumph -- of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.After all of this being said, I am on the fence as to whether this book lives up to all the buzzes and even deserving of being made a movie.  There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure.  I do not regret reading this book, I only wish it was more engrossing.
4 Enjoyable reading.  I never really knew much about the circus, and this was an inside glance probably set in truth.
4 No, I won't forget WATER FOR ELEPHANTS any time soon. The prologue is one of the best I've read in a long time. I actually called a friend and ready it to her out loud. The characters, in particular, Rosie the elephant and Jacob are accurate and tender, each in their own sometimes sad and poignant way. This book is a summer hit for a reason--it's an enjoyable read filled with the peculiarities of circus life that intrigue and woo all who are drawn to such a menagerie known as the "Greatest Show on Earth." ~Carol D. O'Dell
4 Even though I do not patronize circuses & didn't want to read about one, this was certainly interesting, steeping the reader in the Depression times and all that it implied & actually doing exactly what the author intended, hissing the bad guy & loving the couple who surmount all odds & win in the end.
4 I liked the way this novel was written, some in the present, and then in the past.  Satisfying ending.
5 BOOK IS BOTH OF HISTORICAL VALUE AND WONDERFUL LOVE STORY ALONG WITH GREAT PORTRAYAL OF INVISIBILITY OF OLD AGE THROWN IN.
4 Water for Elephants is a fun read. It's not a profound work, but as entertainment, it works well. I really admire the detail and characterization. My favorite character? The elephant.
4 I loved this book. I loved the circus atmosphere and the story. It was exceptionally well-written, and I enjoyed every page.We have a vet student joining a circus, with mistreated animals he's frantically trying to save and protect. We have a lovable elephant. The narrator is an old man looking back, and he recounts his tale in the immediacy of present tense as he describes situations that happened decades earlier. Interesting, and very effective choice, to write in present tense throughout.The ONLY thing that keeps me from giving the book five stars was the lack of character development for Marlena. Throughout the story I understood the protagonist loved her, but she seemed to be the woman tied to the railroad tracks throughout - Nell being constantly tormented by Snidely Whiplash - and I never really got a sense of her as a person. Maybe I missed it (not surprising - I read the book in daily spurts while I walked a treadmill), but I didn't even know how old she was. I got a much clearer picture of minor characters, like Rosemary, Kinko and Camel, than I ever did of her.I also never understood the whole "water for elephants" thing that the protagonist railed about in the beginning of the book. Perhaps it was something else I missed.Nevertheless, I loved the book, I loved the ending, and I know I'll go back to read it again.
5 Well, I spent 30 minutes writing a thorough review for one of the best books I've read in a long time, and--it's been three days--and it's not showing up.  I can't recreate what took so long to write, so I'll just say...this book is woooonderful.  I hated for it to end.
5 This is a wonderful book.  Beautifully written and thoroughly engrossing.  An absolute pleasure.  Highly and enthusiastically recommended.
5 I still haven't watched the movie and don't intend to. The book was amazing and I read it in about 2 days because I just couldn't put it down!
5 Reading a good book is a chance to run off with the circus--to escape into a fun and exciting world totally unlike one's own. This is Gruen's gift to her readers. I got completely absorbed in the double stories of the old man in assisted living and the young man in the circus. By starting her book with the reflections of an old person looking back, this novel reminded me of Evening as well as Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. The black-and-white photos add a lot too. The historic photo on page 70 of the so-called gentleman "freak" is shocking, isn't it? A fast-paced enjoyable book.--Carol Weston, author of Melanie Martin novels for children and teen advice booksGirltalk Fourth Edition: All the Stuff Your Sister Never Told You.
5 A wonderful story!  If nothing else this is an insight into the aging process.  As a child growing up in the 40's my dad took me to  watch the set up of Ringling Brother's Circus when it came to town and we went back that night to watch the teardown.  I never saw a show until I was 12 years old and worked watering horses for my pass into the show.  I remember getting to hold a very small tiger cub that had been recently born.  It was a thrill I will never forget.  So very glad that a friend told me to read &#34;Water for Elephants&#34;.  I am sure that I will reread it again in the future.  Buy it!  You won't be sorry if you remember the circus coming to town!
4 As I've started to branch out to reading a different type of book, Water for Elephants caught my eye, so I had to pick it up. I am so glad that I did! The setting was so raw and gritty and having it based on the history of circuses made it that much more fascinating. Sara Gruen was able to describe things so that I could easily picture the settings and all the circus workers. I just hope that the movie lives up to the book!
5 Wonderful book.  It kept my attention through the entire book.  I did wish there had been more on their life together later.
5 Water for Elephants is a compelling story told from the memory of a ninety-one (or ninety-three)year-old man named Jacob Jankowski. The story begins as Jacob prepares to sit for his veterinary exams at Cornell University. He receives word that his parents have been killed in a car accident and things go downhill from there. He ends up as part of a circus and the next three-and-a-half months are mostly a living hell, except for Marlena.The story goes back and forth between the present time in the "assisted-living" home where Jacob resides and his memories of the past. His children/grandchildren/great grandchildren take turns visiting him, but first-born son, Simon, misses the most important day of all. In the end, this misstep creates for Jacob, and the reader, a most satisfying end to a moving and heartwarming life story. (A bonus in this book is what the reader learns about circus life in the early part of the 20th century, most of which is pretty nasty.)As I care for my aged mother in her home, I am very grateful that we have been able to keep her here. This book provides a perspective from the viewpoint of the very elderly, who, while not as quick on all fronts as they once were, are still thinking, feeling beings.Carolyn Rowe Hill
4 I loved the first 90% of this book.  Whenever I opened it to read, I fell right into circus life in the 1930s, as told by the 93-year-old main character looking back on his life of 70 years previous.  My complaint is that the ending seemed rushed and contrived.  There were lose ends that didn't make sense.  For all of the reality of the first part of the book, the end seemed too fantastic.  Did the editor say "Wrap it up all ready!"?  I think this would make a TERRIFIC movie--just wait for the rights to be sold.  A good summer read, too.
5 This book provided a vivid illustration.  I could see the story playing in my head.  I recommend this book as a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon
4 I don't care what the reviews say, I thought Water for Elephants was a great read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Jacob's stories, both in the past and in the present, were extremely well written. I found his innocence and charm as a young man quite enchanting. Wouldn't it be grand if all young men were as courteous and as sweet as the young Jacob Jankowski? I also really liked the crotchety 90-year old Jacob, whose temper tantrums and emotional outbursts were most certainly justified. The loss of independence is something that we all fear, even more so when a person has lived a long and full life only to be left alone in a senior's home to die.I also thought Marlena's character was well-written. Divorce in the 1920s and 1930s was unheard of, and I can only imagine how awful it must have been for a woman to realize that she had to endure the rest of her life with someone she despised. I found myself wondering when she was going to make the decision to live for herself, rather than do what everyone expected her to do. Then again, she had already made that decision once by leaving her family, so I expected that she would come to the right decision at some point.As for Gruen's research into circus life during the Depression, I think that she did a fantastic job. America during the Great Depression is such a fascinating piece of history, and when you add the excitement of an all-American circus show to the mix, it becomes ever more so. All in all, Water for Elephants was a great read and I will be sure to recommend it to my family and friends.
5 LOVED this book. It is now one of my all time favorites. A must read for anyone. Has romance, animals, and a thriller. Has a little of everythimg for anyone. Have already recommended it to people.
5 Water for Elephants entertains and enlightens the reader with vibrant characters that jump from the page. They paint a picture of life in the circus in the late 1930's;  sometimes grand and often tragic.
5 I lent it to my mother and bought this paper back version for my daughter. She shared it with all her friends.  Much different story than the movie.
5 Jacob Jankowski is 93 years old, but don't let his age fool you:  He's still sharp as a tack.  He lives in an assisted living facility, where he's forced to eat food he doesn't like and socialize with residents who are younger, but far worse off, than himself.  As he faces the realities of his advanced age and begins to deal with the ravages of time on his body, Jacob reflects on his younger years, when he worked as a veterinarian for a traveleing circus known as the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  He joins the circus at 23, at the height of the Great Depression, right after his parents are killed in a car accident and right before he graduates from veterinary school.Most of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is written in flashback, taking readers back to Jacob's beautiful and strange years with the circus during the 1920s and '30s.  While working for the circus, Jacob falls in love with two girls:  Marlena, the circus's star performer, and Rosie, a bull elephant no one else seems to want.  But there are complications, of course:  Marlena's husband, August, is the "equestrian director" of the circus--and he's also very possessive, obsessive, unpredictable, and cruel, not past beating both his wife and his animals if they don't adhere to his commands.  But Jacob's love for Marlena and Rosie transcends all this, and it will change his life; he has no way of knowing how much. Now, as an old man near the end of it all, trapped in a body he doesn't recognize, Jacob clings to his memories, to the vestiges of his younger years, as if they are a life raft.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is the story of Jacob Jankowski's life--gritty, surreal, full of vibrance and love. In her third novel, Sara Gruen brings to life a dazzling cast of characters in a vivid landscape little-explored in contemporary fiction.  The world she has created for her readers is, well, otherworldly:  magical and strange and startlingly real.  Her Depression-era train circus resounds with authenticity; she borrows anecdotes from her research and uses circus slang to add a sense of immediacy to the experience. Her prose is simple and unpretentious, poetic in its own way.  Simply put:  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is just lovely!I can't say anything bad about WATER FOR ELEPHANTS; I think it deserves every bit of praise it receives.  Jacob is such a compelling character, so utterly well-drawn.  His vibrancy as a young man jumps off the page at you; so does his frustration with being trapped in a withering body as an old man.  Gruen's tale moves back and forth in time seamlessly, and it's obvious how much she cares about her characters--even the non-human ones.  Her love story is impeccably researched, alternately heartbreaking and hopeful, romantic and violent. And the ending?--it's absolutely perfect.  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS took me somewhere no other piece of fiction ever has--and I can honestly say I enjoyed every page of the journey.
5 Cannot say enough about this book, so all I will say is I could not put it down and never wanted it to end.
4 What a delightful book!  I learned so much about the circus and its workings, truly a treasure. In between all the "depressing issues" there were moments of true goodness and hope. I've recommended it to all my reading friends.
5 What an amazing story!  Such interesting details about circus life...scary and gripping, and funny and sweet all at once.  The characters were so carefully drawn that I really felt for them and wanted to know even more about them.  I  was beguiled and spellbound to the very end.
4 I wasn't sure about this book when I chose it but it turned out to be a wonderful read!  I enjoyed reading about the circus secrets (both pleasant and ugly) and the drama in the love story was completely plausible, and the old Jacob was delightful.  As a person who lives 30 minutes away from the PT Barnum Museum in Bridgeport Connecticut and has visited it often, I just could picture all of this and I loved it.
4 Good book,  caught my attention right away with all the details about circus life.  I really enjoyed reading it.  My only qualm is with the ending because it's a little too pat for my taste.  Life doesn't ever end up so nice.
5 heard about this book from a friend and was unable to put it down! as a healthcare worker, the character of older jacob has insights all should be aware of and consider. vivid imagery and a fascinating plot. highly reccomended
4 This book surprised me.  I usually don't read the summaries on the book jackets because I find that it spoils the story for me and so I didn't really know what to expect from this book.  However, by the end of the book, I was thoroughly fulfilled.  I loved the author's insight into seeing things from the perspective of the "90 or 93 yo" main character.  I found I couldn't put the book down once started.  I also liked the Q&A commentary at the back of the book telling how the author researched circus life - especially the story about Rosie - to include in the novel.  Great storytelling!
2 I was very eager to read this novel. The picture on the cover intrigued me; that's as far as the fascination went. The book was not very interesting. It read like a documentary with a few poorly written graphic scenes to keep its readers reading. I finished it, but wouldn't read it and again and won't recommend it.
5 I couldn't put this book down. I have seen the awards it won, but never thought about getting it, I wondered who this Sara Gruen is, never read her books. SO I didn't go out of my way to pick it up. Somebody brought it in to work. We have a bookshelf full of books that we share. I saw it and thought, OK, now I am going to read that, it is here, I keep seeing it, I am taking the plunge!How wonderful. I was completely and totally into the book after reading the first 4-5 pages. I couldn't put it down. I loved it, this isn't my type of book normally. However, it is a great read. I felt like I was standing next to the big top through the whole book. Get it, read it and enjoy it, that is the purpose of this book.
5 I loved this book it wasn't something I would have normally read. I was given this book by a friend and I was amazed that I got so into it.
5 ** spoiler alert ** Before I picked this much talked about book, particularly since the film came out, I heard from a few friends that they couldn't read it because of the animal abuse. When I thought that's what the book was about, I actually didn't want to read it either not because I care so much but because I'm not quite as impassioned on the topic. It's not that I'm heartless or ignorant of that. It's just that I don't need to read anything about that topic to make me "feel" the injustice. But, with the hype and since I love to compare books to film, I figured I had to read it before I saw the film with Edward...ahem I mean Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. So, I did and immediately I was drawn in. I enjoyed how the narrative sliced between present day retirement home and past circus life. I appreciated the difficulties and heartaches of dealing with old age and time passing, with loneliness and loss of certain freedoms, with death. Of course, I also loved how the two main characters grew, fell in love, and fought against the obstacles to be together.It actually reminded me of Sparks' The Notebook. So, if you liked that and you like the circus, this is definitely the read for you. And for those animal rights activists, I didn't find the scenes of animal abuse that offensive. That topic is definitely a character in the book and certainly touched upon vividly BUT it's not accepted as just fact. It's shown for just what it is...horrendous...and that seems to make it more palatable. So, I would encourage the read anyway.
5 Take a chance and read this book.  It is wonderfully written.  Such an interesting book to take the lead character and having him in a nursing home, thinking of his life... and what a great life.  What a heart warming story.  I'm fascinated by the freakish carnivale life, and this didn't disappoint (but uphold) that theory!  If you're in for an uplifting tale of struggle and happiness in an unexpected way, you've found the perfect all-around book.  Enjoy!
2 Everyone was talking about it last summer, and my book club decided to read it. I was very disappointed. Characters were not believable, there was too much cruelty to animals and violence here, nobody I really liked except the dwarf, and the back and forth from the young man to the nursing home got very dreary. I skipped a lot of pages because the early part was so boring.
5 I loved this book. I'd been hearing so much about it prior to the film that I decided I had to read it. No one had really told me what the book was about so I was more than pleasantly surprised at the subject matter. I have always had an interest in the Great Depression and riding the Circus Train during that time period with Jacob was one of the best trips of my life. Sara Gruen's writing is descriptive and made me feel like I was actually involved in the lives of her characters. It was an easy read but a cause for dismay when it ended. I wanted it to go on and on. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who just enjoys a good story.
3 I did enjoy this book although I wouldn't say it was great. Maybe best for a easy poolside read. The characters were fun and the story believable. Worth the read.
4 I could not help but notice that reading Sarah Gruen's Water For Elephants is very much like watching the movie "Titanic."  First and foremost, each offers big historic pageantry, with a rousing "you are there" quality.  Each features two parallel narratives from the same protagonist, one in advanced age, one in a defining passage in young adulthood.  Both feature a romantic triangle involving a young woman who is a victim of her times stuck in a marriage or engagement to a cruel powerful man and the young man of no means who becomes her soulmate and savior.  Both send the young man to a fancy dress dinner in a borrowed tux. Both create insular worlds that are set apart from the rest of the earth, one by an ocean, the other by the train-bound peripatetic exotica of circus life, and within that insular world there is a class structure inspiring social commentary.  Both the Titanic creators and Gruen took admirable artistic risks in going to material that nobody else was treating and both did their homework on historical detail.Water For Elephants is about circus life in the early years of the Great Depression.  It successfully captures glimpses of the American experience and opens up the closed world of the circus that is at once a very dangerous place and a warm sanctuary.  Gruen does not spare the gritty reality of disregard for human and animal life.  She succeeds in creating a very delicately balanced community that can slide into disaster if shoved off balance.  Thinking on the living conditions she portrays, sometimes you have to ask, why would anyone stick with this mess?  For the narrator, Jacob Jankowski, it is love for animals, friends and the aforementioned girl.Water For Elephants is, like the Titanic, a large scale entertainment but when it comes down to it, there is no one line or character that is surprising (except perhaps for the elephant).  The book is well crafted but not artistic.  It may have been very different in the hands of John Steinbeck or EL Doctorow.  That said, Gruen gets points for following through on her inspiration and delivering a book that is very atmospheric and historically interesting, with some social commentary mixed in.This edition comes with a worthwhile interview with Gruen and a book club discussion guide that is more like a junior high English class test.
5 What a terrific read......It also intrigued me to learn more about the history of the circus and possible trip to a circus museum in Florida.......There should definitely be a movie on this book.......recommend it!
3 Sara Gruen delivers a readable tale that's a tad too formulaic to be fully engaging. In the same way that the narrator of the story insists from personal experience that it is impossible to carry enough water to slake an elephant's thirst, I'd insist that this container doesn't hold enough water to satisfy a serious reader.Also noted: the description of animals and animal behaviors is approximately cartoony, and takes away from the whole.On the flip side, it is an easy read that won't occupy more than an evening and Gruen does offer up some fascinating historical details about old-style railroad circuses, which altogether comes off as plausibly true.
5 This is one book I didn't want to end! I read it in one day, just can't put it down! Eventhough the scenes go back and forth between the circus and the nursing home, Sara Gruen made the scenes flow almost seamlessly. It made me wish that I was there in the circus. The scenes in the nursing home made me want to go to one and just hug the elederly residents there. This book is definitely the BEST!!!!!
5 Water for elephants is one of the best books l,'ve read in sometime.Hard to quit reading once you start.highly recommended for all adults.
5 Frankly, all of the good things have been said about this book by other reviewers. I can only thank Public Radio that had a review of it. Otherwise I would not have heard of it.One of the things that the book points out is how tough life was during the depression.  American today have no concept of what it was like for people who earned no money, had no money, and had no place to go. There were no homeless shelters, no social security.  It was a different world.Gruen does a great job of showing the read the America of the Depression years and also tells a wonderful story.
1 The prologue to this book put me off a little, containing as it did a very descriptive act of violence, but I persevered since someone had recommended this book to me.  Two more very ugly, explicit and disgusting sexualized "scenes" in the very early pages had me deleting the whole thing and not reading any further.  I'm told this has been made into a movie, which not only beggars belief, but illustrates why I rarely find a movie these days that is worth watching.
3 Purchased book based on reviews and I am a firm believer of reading a book before viewing the movie. The author does a great job of transporting you to this era and what it actually like to be apart of a great circus traveling by train. The author gives very detailed and explicit images of the scenery, animals, costumes and characters.However there are not smooth transitions from character to character due to the main character telling the story as an older man and hid younger self. It was hard sometimes to distinguish the difference between characters so much so I had to go back and re-read a page an then be like oh okay this is so and so.***SPOILER ALERT BELOW***I didn't care for the ending of this book either. I didn't think that it was realistic for the main character to leave his nursing home without aide (since in the story he can barely make it from the table to the window). Also he can barely button 3 buttons on his shirt, so how is he going to sell tickets at the booth to the circus? He meets a young man and he just volunteers to take care of him for the rest of his life (and he's 93)? This young man that he meets is no relation to him, it's just really hard foe me to believe that a young man running a traveling circus would take this all on.
4 From the other reviews, i was expecting to have my socks knocked off as I had in "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls and "Replay" by Ken Grimwood, but instead I found that I was pleasantly entertained. No more. No less. The most impressive parts of this book were Sara's portrayal of the elderly. I imagine that life for the elderly is pretty much as she portrays it, which I found enlightening and interesting. These parts ended up being my favorite! The rest of the book is colorful, imaginative, and worthwhile.
5 This book is easy to get into, and once you're there, you won't want put the book down.  The author's use of imagery paints the scenes so well, with a believable but unusual assortment of characters.  It entertains and engrosses you with turns and twists in the story line.  I loved it!
5 A story that reminds you that it is never to late to have an adventure.Don't pick it up .... unitl you are prepared to read it from cover to cover- becasue once you start you wount want to put it down.I am eargerly awaiting the film version.
4 Very well written and and very grabbing. There were, however, 2 raunchy parts that were a little graphic, especially since they didn't really effect the whole story much. These moments felt as if they were elaborated on specifically in to draw in a larger audience via random moments of smut. For me, it cheapened an otherwise 5 star book. Really now, that was an image of a cartoon character that I did not want inside my head!LIke I said. Beautifully written--but I would have preferred if the aforementioned parts were briefly stated so you knew they happened and then moved on [like the rape scenes in Khaled Hosseini's book (Kite runner, or even the marital scenes in 1000 splendid suns) ].
4 I am one of the ones that really liked this book. I honestly chose this book because I knew the movie was coming out and wanted to read it first. I enjoyed the book better than the movie. There was much more detail. You could see the characters struggles and how they got there. I would recommend this book. It is a really fast read though.
3 started off great...didn't care for it as it went on. The animal abuse really bothered me and I really didn't like the way it ended...sorry....
5 The author alternates the time period and venue between chapters. It's a fascinating story and even more amazing considering the author is a woman and the protagonist is a 90-year-old man.
5 When I picked up this book, I was not sure what to expect. The first few pages hooked me and it was all I could do not to put the book down til the very last page. I spent a season with the blue unit of Ringling Brothers back in the 80s and even though the life has changed a great deal from the circus trains during the depression, the lifesytle is quite similiar. The different cliques, the constant travel schedule and life on the road. I remember many a nights sitting with other "joeys" and talking with the oldtimers who told similiar tales as in Water for Elephants.  My thanks to Sara for bringing back some great memories of my own circus career and putting a great story to such a facinating and unknown part of history for many people.  I do wish she had gone a little deeper into some of the other acts and aspects of circus life, but maybe there is another novel about life on the Ringling circuit. Loved the ending - so appropriate. Have recommended this book to all my friends and if you are looking for a thriling, dramatic read, this book is for you. Does not matter if you are not into circus life, this is so much more. It is about living, learning, trying to be the best you can be and never giving up. 5 stars - would give it more, but 5 is all that Amazon allows. Those who give this book 1 and 2 stars have no idea what they are talking about - have you read the book?
5 I'm usually drawn to books written about the depression era, as I have heard so much about it from my parents.  This book is not only that, but a great insight to the circus life during that time.  I had a hard time putting this book down in the evenings (after a day at work), and it was good timing that my spouse was out of town for the week.  Very well written, a great story, and a page turner. I'll be buying copies for future gifts.
5 This is definately one of the best books I read all year. I fell in love with the characters and the story. I couldn't put it down.
4 Enjoyed the unique look at circus life in that time.  Also, the author had a very good understanding of, not only the process of aging, but how a person experiencing it thinks and feels!  The ending was surprising and pleasant, but not really realistic.
5 Loved this book.  It portrays the life of survival of humans and animals alike.  It has always amazed me how elephants put up with us ignorant humans and our slow mentality in catching on as to how to treat them according to their abilities. The fact that elephants haven't done away with all evil handlers is a testament to the amazing personality, patience and attitude of their creation. The circus realm has a lot of shame, guilt and blame placed at its feet. Even though this is a fictional story, the real stories of circus elephants is much worse and a hard read.  I'm looking forward to another place in time where all will live in peace with all living things as this great earth was intended.
5 This book kept me up past midnight this morning; it was the selection for our book discussion group this afternoon.  Each person in our group rated it a 5, which generally means the book was so good we couldn't put it down.I qualified my vote by saying I would give it a 5 for the author's work in researching her material and in linking Jacob's 90 or 93-year old self to his younger self along with her use of dreams and/or daydreams.The book was a page-turner as another member of our group had told me.  It arrived from amazon.com on Tuesday after I finally decided to pay full price for it since I was not finding a really good buy for a used copy elsewhere online.I am generally a slow reader, wanting to picture each event in my mind before I continue.  However, the book went pretty fast since it has a lot of dialog.One thing our book discussion group questioned.  How could Jacob be so sure that Mr. McGuinty could not have carried water for the elephants?  Couldn't he have been one of a number of boys who carried buckets of water to the elephants?  The author did not explain this.We saw some similarities to the Jacob in the Bible, but perhaps we missed some which the author included.  My Bible tells me that the name Jacob means "deceiver" so in what way were we deceived by him?  Were the last two chapters factual, or were they daydreams which came to Jacob as he sat in his wheelchair?
5 Water for Elephants is one of my all-time favorite books.  I read it in one sitting on a plane and then on an airport bus.  I was captivated the whole time.  I enjoyed it so much that I later checked out the audio version from the library and enjoyed it just as much, if not more.  Definitely worth a read for anyone who likes elephants, circuses, veterinarians, period fiction (Depression Era), or just good books in general.
4 This is a very interesting and well-told story which kept my attention all the way through. I only gave it four stars because even though I liked the book a lot, I probably wouldn't recommend it to others because there were several sexual situations that were somewhat graphic.
5 I'm so glad I finally got around to reading this book. I purchased it a while ago, thinking it was going to be the next read in my book club. That didn't happen and I actually forgot I had it on my Kindle.Truth be told, I waffled between 4 and 5 stars. Here's why...**Spoilers**Although flashing back between old Jacob and young Jacob ended up necessary for the reader to get the whole story, it was a bit annoying to me at first. Well, really, for most of the book. It wasn't that I didn't enjoy the old Jacob parts, they were very well written. The young Jacob parts were so well written, the change from one perspective to the other often threw me out of the story. I would be reading along, really into the story. Bam! Now we're back in the nursing home. It really distracted me. I even noted, about the third time this happened, that there better be a reason for the back and forth or I would look at it as a crutch the author felt she had to use. I still don't feel it was totally necessary to have old Jacob, but it was nice to have the closure that point of view was able to give us.Regardless, I will be recommending this book to all the readers I know. Not so much for the romance, to me that was a side story, but for the relationships Jacob had with the rest of the characters.
5 Loved this book.  A true to life story and unique because it is about a man's life in his words. Easily read and comfortable transition between past and present.  Great unexpected ending.
1 There might be a good story here, but personally, the excessive profanity and sexual situations were offputting.  I returned the book unfinished.
5 Though I am an avid reader and read hundreds of books a year, this is the first time I have felt the need to review a fiction book for Amazon.  There are very few books that I read that I will always remember or possibly even read again but this is one of them.  I read and enjoyed Gruen's other two books "Riding Lessons" and "Flying Changes" but was overwhelmed by "Water for Elephants".  I liked the fact that the past is being recalled by a 90 (possibly 93) year old man - you don't find many books that have an elderly protaganist and it was refreshing.  I enjoyed the many animals in the story - Rosie and Bobo especially.  I enjoyed learning about the traveling circuses and felt that Gruen really did do a wonderful job researching this book (I think the old circus photos added a nice touch, too).  The story fit together seamlessly and I was disappointed when it ended - I would have liked to read about the married years in more depth.  The ending surprised and delighted me. This was a great "feel good" book.
5 I was captivated by this book. The bits of historical data mixed with fiction made the story seem more authentic.The tale is told by a 93-year-old man in a nursing home. His recollections lend to the authenticity of this story. At first, it seemed like this had been a real relative of the author. When I realized that it was not, I was amazed with the author's creativity.
3 The book is a good book but in no way great.  The descriptions of the time period and the circus was great but the story was predictable to excess.  The characters were contrived and stereotypical.  I did enjoy parts of the story but it is not a great novel, it is merely an entertaining read.
5 Set in the Great Depression, this is the story of the spectacle of The Big Top. It will put both its hands around the heart and touch that heart in just about every conceivable way a heart can be affected.It has a motley cast of characters -- curiosities with two and four legs, animal lovers and haters, humanitarians and saddists, an absolutely unforgettable Elephant (Capital E) named Rosie, plus the irascible, irreverent, bellicose, and lovable narrator named Jacob.The writing is first-class, the crafting is painstaking, the characters are compelling, the pathos, laughter, joy, and soul is addicting. Such an emptiness after finishing this wonderful work. Highly, highly recommended, especially for animal lovers!! (And for this Chicago person, it was an added delight to know the locations in Chicago that added to this story.)Word to the wise: this work touches on some of the dark side of the circus -- some, but not all -- so go inside with the eyes wide open. As an animal lover, this side is the one that grinds my bones to powder. And yet, only a small bit of the dark was given -- more could have been added, but was not.The post script is just a personal observation and strong affirmation ~ that henceforth there will be no more Big Tops, Rodeos, Dog Fights, Animal Races, Bull Fights, or any other cruelties that will be offered as "entertainment" for humanity. Where is the humanity in any one of those events???
5 This book was absolutely wonderful!  Sara Gruen is an amazing writer and the story is wonderful.  I could hardly put it down once I started and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great read.
5 It's the early 1920s. Jacob Jankowski is about to finish up his veterinary degree at Cornell University when he learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash. Stunned by this awful and sudden turn of events, Jacob completely blanks while taking his final exams. He walks out and wanders out of town in a complete daze, eventually jumping a train. It turns out he has jumped the circus train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Jacob pretty much instantly falls for Marlena, one of the star performers. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the animal manager, who is, as we come to find out, a paranoid schizophrenic with erratic behavior problems. The story focuses on these three characters as the circus train makes its way around the country, performing in various cities. Along the way, the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob befriends his reluctant roommate, and tries to save an ailing friend from being tossed from the circus.This is a really interesting and moving book. It's really fascinating to read about daily circus life and how things worked. And it's a touching story about a smart elephant, a compassionate vet, and a forbidden love. I do wish there had been some more charater development for Rosie the elephant, though. Also, the story is told in retrospect, from a present-day Jacob who is now in his 90s. Every few chapters, the story skips back to present day, and the nursing home-bound narrator. I felt the story would have worked a lot better if it had just stuck to the circus part of the story. The present day interjections were distracting. Other than that, this was an excellent book. Highly recommended.
3 I listened to the audiobook version of this book (great production!) but was one of those who was somewhat disappointed. I had read the glowing reviews and thought I'd give it a try. I listened to it all and thought the characters were wonderful but the plot was so slow. I felt like there were so many opportunities that the author had with the themes, time period, etc.that were not used. I give it three stars but there are so many other good books out there worth the 11 hours of time.
2 Can a stint of a few months in a circus change a boy's life forever? Yawn. The novel is peopled with cut-outs: a diligent country boy orphaned the day before his final exams; an ethereally beautiful horse-tamer with a secret problem (a loutish husband); perverted dwarves; whores with golden hearts; etc. Retold from a retirement home, the novel seems prepped for cinematic treatment, and doesn't linger in literature. It hurtles towards a pre-ordained resolution: the match made in heaven, in the book, and a movie contract for the author. Boo.
5 Fantastic read.  I flew straight through it in just a few intense sessions, eyes locked to the page over an hour at a time.  Couple of quick book comparisons immediately come to mind.  First, I'm reminded of the great line near the beginning of "Life of Pi", that informs the reader that they are about to hear a story that will make them believe in God.  I wrapped myself around that line and read in hopes of the book keeping that promise.  It's a bold promise, so I reward the book for its effort, but I'm not sure it lead to any true converts.  We get a similar sentiment in the beginning of "Water for Elephants."  Jacob pulls us in by insinuating that he's about to tell us a secret he's kept for over seventy years.  Again, I found myself lured into the book's "Big Top" to find that secret.  And much like an old-world carnival, I found my main attraction and enjoyed all of the book's turns and sideshows.Another book comparison that comes to mind is with "Iron Weed," a Pulitzer Prize winner in the eighties.  Like, "Iron Weed," this book does really an excellent job of submersing you in the feel and sense of being flat broke and in dire straights, trying to negotiate survival during the Great Depression. During a long stretch inside the world the book creates, I could literally feel the dust and dirt being kicked up by the roustabouts and workers, as the tents went up.  Gruen took my into those crammed, dirty box cars, and murky late-night binges.  I was there.One more favorite from the book.  The author somehow manages to make the internal world of a ninety or ninety-three year old man, trapped and forgotten in a nursing home, just about as interesting as the glitz and glamor of the show and the drama it unfolds.  That's no easy feat, but she does it well.  I was left thinking about aging, long after I had let go of the circus.  Jacob's thoughts about how senility sort of creeps in and his explanations of his two worlds, and no longer being sure where one ends and the other begins, stayed with me.  An excellent, excellent book.Chris BowenAuthor of,Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom
5 Not everyone loves this book but I did!  It was my first novel read on my new Kindle Paper White!
5 I finished this book a few weeks ago and I still am thinking about it. The characters are all unique and the animals as well. Life was hard  in those times people  had to survive.
4 This novel was full of interesting characters and captured the difficult economic situation that many were placed in by circumstances over which they had little control. The reality of the desperation and the lack of value for human life bought the story of circus life during these harsh times.
2 Water for Elephants has its good moments (a particular incident late in the book, during which the protagonist is standing over a sleeping but dangerous man with knife in hand trying to decide what to do next is hauntingly poignant), but all told, I'm glad that I read this book through the Kindle leasing program rather than buying it.There are several themes in Water for Elephants, including the lack of dignity often associated with the treatment of the elderly and the evil effects of greed. However, the backbone of the story seems to be a sort of iconoclasm. The Sterling images of the circus often inculcated in us during childhood are challenged by images of violence, animal cruelty, and graphic sexuality. However, the fact that this book unearths the dark side of the early twentieth century circus speaks less to its quality than to the fact that our society all too often allows commercialism and popular mythology to shape our images of the past. Simply challenging false notions held by society contributes very little to the value of a story like this one. In the end, the tone of the book takes on moods which can change violently from the darkly cynical to the unrealistically optimistic (the ending of the book feels impossible, illegal, and unsafe). Sentimentality, rather than a meaningful exploration of human emotion, dominates the scenes of the assisted living facility, although as noted above, the fact that those scenes also bring to light the continuing need for respect to the elderly does serve to redeem them to a decent extent.The story is, on some level, a "forbidden romance", and on this level, it has many failings. The rapidity with which Marlena falls for Jacob seems more indicative of a woman torn by the violent nature of her relationship than a woman in anything approaching love. The way in which August is killed seems to do nothing but Grant a legitimacy to the relationship via Pacidermis ex Machina, and to tie up loose ends.All in all, this isn't an awful book, but it seems to be the type of story commonly found in book discussion groups for all of two months before being rapidly forgotten. There is no real draw, beyond a handful of tense and well-written moments in the last quarter of the story.For the Kindle edition, images work surprisingly well, and I have no real complaints about formatting.
4 Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants will probably top the list for the books I read in 2010 (3 months left, so come on authors, wow me!).  It is evident that Gruen painstakingly researched life in the 1930's circuis, and her hard work paid off with a nice slice of Americana.  The book's plot kept me turning pages late into the night.Others have complained about the book's vulgarity, and I'll admit that several scenes were a bit too vulgar for my taste, but the subject is the depression-era circus, not nursery school.  While not necessarily pleasant, it was probably befitting the subject matter.The greatest praise I'll give Gruen was in her ending.  The fiction-literature authors of the last decade seem to be of the notion that a depressing ending makes for good literature.  I would like to remind these authors that I read fiction as an escape from reality, not as a desire to have more of it.  To Gruen's credit, she reached for the best ending possible, and she nailed it!  I hope the rest of her books are as good as this one!
5 I loved this book - there are a few naysayers in the sea of positive reviews and there is a reason for this.  It is an excellent book - of course it is not air tight but it is a fun read and interesting.  It reminded me in some way of the White City book in that it took history, in this case of the circus in a certain time period in history, and wove a story around this history.  It took me a little less then two days to read it and well worth the story!ooking for a fun fast read with a great story line - buy and enjoy this book!
4 I did not like the many sexual content, yet I do realize in some way to make this entirely a realistic book one has to have some of that.  I particularly did not care for circus performance of the LADY ...  But what I did like was the beginning of the story of the nursing home.  I truly felt sorry for the H and It truly made me want to visit the elderly.
5 Love this book! The story was so interesting and kept you wanting more! I learned about circus life all while enjoying a great story.
3 Not that I wanted to know anything about the circus - ever - let alone the circus during the 30s, but there you have it. I read this for a book club; I'd never have chosen it for myself and was the only person to not enjoy the book. While I skimmed much of the circus part, I found myself enjoying the here-and-now part with Jacob in the nursing home.He was the type of character I enjoy, with his ornery comments and the loss he endured. Not necessarily with the death of his beloved wife, but with the forgetfulness of his surviving family, his children and grandchildren. It was almost as if he was an afterthought once he was in the Home - out of sight out of mind. That was heartbreaking, and I could see why he chose the end he did - to run away and spend the last bit of his life doing something he could, where people needed him and wouldn't forget him.The young Jacob's life - eh. He was weak, not very bright and I question how he managed to get into an Ivy League school. But then they don't test you on common sense. There was no real consequence for his actions in the circus, and he managed (drunk death defying feats on a moving train notwithstanding) to consistently escape his actions.I admit to not guessing the entire ending, though it was obvious who his wife was since her introduction. The writing was full of flowery clich&eacute;s, and there were several places I wish Ms. Gruen would've gone over again to plug up some holes and take out excessive details, but overall it did work. I just wasn't interested in it.
5 I enjoyed the story and it definitely kept my interest. I kept wanting to see what would happened next, so I finished it in just a couple days.
5 What a great story! Now I'm sure we'll go see the movie.  The author did an excellent job with the plot and her research for details was awesome. Very good portrayal of the time period. Loved the ending, I work in a nursing home and could really feel for the main character - don't want to spoil it for anyone but it was the perfect way to finish! I've read it twice and also listened to the audio!
4 I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a really good story but also sad.  The end was a little far fetched, but worth your time.
5 I loved how this story switched between the past and the present.  I haven't read a book like that in awhile, so I was really happy for something different...a little break from the norm.  I couldn't put this book down, and now heard it is being made into a movie.  Woo hoo!
5 This book surprised me by how moving and beautiful it is contrasted by the dark and ugly of circus life.I really wasn't sure I would like it, but again my book club chose to read it. A character driven story that gives insight into a lifestyle most never think about.
5 Fell in love with the characters!  Although I didn't research the story, it felt very real & could possibly be historically correct about circus'.  This was a page turner... real almost in one sitting.  Now I need to see the movie!
5 This is a great book and is so much more enjoyable than the movie. The writing style is in depth and concise a great read!
4 "Water for Elephants" by Sara Gruen is a well written, depression-era book, that most readers ages 15-95 could read and enjoy even if you think this isn't the typical type of book you would read.This book tells two stories simultaneously as a 93 yr. old crumudgeon embittered by his surroundings in a retirement home recollects his life as he travelled with a second-rate circus while falling in love with a married woman.I probably would have never read this book had it not been for a family book club (Isn't that why you have them), however I'm sure glad I did, I really did enjoy this read and found the pages turned much quicker than I anticipated.I always am interested to see how an author can write in the point-of-view pf the opposite sex and I thought it was executed wonderfully. Also, the terminology that was used was very specific to the time and to how the circus-folk spoke at the time. One could tell Gruen definately did her homework.If there is any drawback it would be the end to one of the stories (I'm not going to say which one or how it ends don't worry). I thought it ended kind of sappy and a little unbeleivable for a story that seems very factual.Bottom line, four stars. I am very stingy with my stars, so please read and enjoy.
5 I listened to the audio CD, which is narrated by one voice for the older Jacob and one for the younger Jacob.  The reading is superb, and the story is unusual, but terrific.  I listened to it twice before I donated it to the local senior commmunity, where they had chosen it for their monthly book club.  I highly recommend it, particularly for an experience 'off the beaten path.'
5 I read a lot of books and save my reviews for the ones that I really love - this story was wonderful. I literally read it from start to finish in one sitting. Jacob's story is amazing. A must read. Really don't know what more to say except that you should read this book.
5 While I am not a circus fan, this book takes the reader back to a tragic time in the late 20's and early 30's to "witness" the life of the people living the life of the train circus exsistence. I admire the author's work to provide the research to make this story not only horrifying at times, but also has an interest in this era of our history. There were many times I felt that it was difficult to put it down - definitely worth reading...
5 The book came super fast, packaged perfectly and in perfect condition. Everything I'd expeced it to be. Could hardly believe the speed in which I received it.
5 I never write reviews... but for this book I felt the need to! The book was just plain wonderful! I fell in love with Jacob both old and young! I got it for my Kindle but i am going to have to by the DTB as well! love this book!!!!! There is no way to really sum this book up, other then wonderful!
5 A quick read with wonderful detail. The characters really come to life on the pages of this book.  I really enjoyed the way the story moves back and forth between young and old Jacob.
5 I really enjoyed reading this book. I saw the movie first, then decided to read it. It's pretty different from the movie but I like that. It's story was great, really made you love Jacob. Must read!
5 I almost bought this book 2 years ago while on vacation. Thought I had too many books in my arms, so I put it down! Wow, what a mistake! I just read it on my kindle and LOVED it. I fell in love with Jacob with the first line. Wonderful book, now I have to check into some more of Sara Gruen's books!
5 This book is well done.  Written in the style of a "life review", it is a look back on the life of a circus, and the characters that made it work.  I was suprised at how well I enjoyed it, and the development of the characters.  The reality of the life style that the carnies lived and  the social prejudcies involved.  This is a worth your time.
5 I don't know why I picked up this book to read, but I'm glad I did!  All summer, I've become bored with other books I've attempted to read but abandoned half way through.Water for Elephants was different.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down.  The author did a great job developing the characters and the story.  I didn't know much about circus life and the story gives the reader a good glimpse of what it was like.  Because I'm an animal lover, I liked how the main character looked out for well being of the circus animals.I recommend this book.
5 The Author weaves an exciting and enduring tale that brings to life an American era. The juxtaposition of the glamorous and gritty circus set in the Depression mirrors the wonderful and grim love story. Each sentence is thoughtfully written, pulling the reader in. Loved it.
5 So far there are 866 reviews for this book, so there's nothing I can say that's different from anyone else.  It got to be so absorbing by the middle of the book with a VERY satisfying ending.  I couldn't resist adding another review to thank Sara Gruen for this wonderful story.  I just finished it a minute ago...I ignored my kids all night while caught up in this story.  Now my kids can have me back!  Please read and enjoy this book.  Thank you.
5 This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I am not a book enthusiast, however this one has grabbed me from the first page and I have had a hard time putting it down. What a dramatic story that is so wonderfully written.If you are wondering if you should get this book or not, do it! You will not be disappointed!!!
2 This was a book club assignment, I had not wanted to read this book because I had heard that there was some animal cruelty but as a member I try to appreciate other peoples book choices as they do mine.The cruelty was a little hard to read, especially the beatings of Rosie but I also found myself cringing at the unneccessary sex scenes that were over the top, boredom at the constant threat of tossing people of the train and disbelief at the stampede of the menagerie.I did like the elderly Jacob and his life at the nursing home, I think it shows how elderly people are often "put on the shelf" when they become a bother in life...so sad.  Then this was spoilt by the idea that he ran away with the circus, was able to sell tickets even if he could not button his shirt and all with the acceptance of the current circus owner.I am sure the circus of that era was not a pleasant place but I think the characters could have been much better developed and the story a little less unbelievable.
5 An excellent read.  Even though it didn't sound like something I would read, it kept me reading.  I couldn't put it down.
5 Im usually skepical when it comes to reading a book that has become a movie . I end up either loving the movie and not liking the book or loving the book and not liking the movie. THIS book was stunning in detail and takes the reader into the 'Big Top' in such detail that you can almost smell the peanuts! It contains violence but it is told with such skill that the reader understands just how brutal humans can be ....but the main character is the hero and does make a difference . As for the romance...its innocent and well written. There is something for all in this story and I see now why it was made into a movie. I have not seen it yet but I can only imagine !
4 I enjoyed reading about the history of the circus and the anecdotes shared by Sara Gruen.  It takes you back to an age of innocence in your life where the Circus was pretty close to the best thing that ever happened to you.  The elephants and the brave ladies that rode on them.  The clowns and the ittle people.  I enjoyed recreating those memories while reading this delightful and sweet account of two circus runaways who fall in love.  Their story was predictable in so many ways.  The old Jacob part was just sad and it left a sour feeling.  However, I did enjoy reading about the circus people and their lives.  The parades and the drama behind the curtain.  The roustabouts working so hard and sleeping in crowded spaces,yet what an adventure! to travel around the country from town to town brining smiles to millions and enjoying the camradie of the circus!  I loved that part.
5 This novel is a wonderful mix of fantasy and reality, pathos and joy!  With the sad tale of Jacob unfolding in the first chapter, the reader is quickly engaged in the story.  The inter-chapters weave the tale from the past into the present and make the reader empathize with Jacob and become endeared to the Circus and its workers.I read chapter 5 to my high school senior English class to give them insight into the life of an old man and his perspective on reminiscence and life.  They loved it!  They even gained new perspective on the elderly that they work with at their community service sites.What a good book!  I recommend it to all ages.  It is fun and full of humanity.
5 This book was made into a good movie a couple of years ago.  I always recommend that you read the book before seeing the film and again, this is the case.  This is an intricate, dramatic love story, with twists that hold your attention.  An excellent read.
5 Who would ever guess that a story about a circus would be so fantastic? The author, Sara Gruen, knew that's who.  Well, she was right. Jacob is lost after the death of his parents.  When he is just a final exam away from his veterinary license he stumbles upon a traveling circus train and inadvertently joins.  Through Jacob we get a glimpse behind the scenes of the the characters, relationships, struggles, and class warfare of circus folk.  Intertwined in this interesting story of the circus is a love story.  I noticed that one of the other reviewers found the love story a bit trite, but I disagree.  I found the love story completely believable and the use of flashback extremely effective.  Most importantly, I must tell you, I cried.  I RARELY cry while reading.  You are are going to dig this book!
5 Passion, hatred, love, and murder; Water for Elephants, the novel by Sara Gruen has it all. It's rare that I read a novel and become so engulfed with the story, but from the first page, I was hooked. The way in which Gruen has the protagonist of the story, Jacob Jankowski, switch back and forth between his 22-year-old self and present day 90 (or 93) year-old self is both creative and effective in capturing her readers. Every single scene has intensity and vibrancy. The juxtaposition of the elderly Jankowski and the young circus worker Jankowski posed a humorous yet almost sad setting for the story. Readers would be crazy not to fall in love with his character.Though fiction, the novel represents the lives of circus workers back in the 1920's and 1930's and gives insight to the gruesome conditions the men had to live in, and the constant struggles that they faced everyday. Each chapter begins with a photograph derived from circuses back from the time Jankowski would have worked. The photos truly show the lives that these men led and let readers see not only imagine how things were. Though the historical value of the novel was fascinating, the forbidden but passionate relationship between Marlena and Jacob was the most captivating portion. The constant secrecy from August and the fear of being revealed created an incredible emotional reaction for me.The corruption of the novel and the intensity of the characters made this novel a hard one to dislike. In my opinion, it has to be one of the best books written in the past few years. If there were one book I had to recommend to anyone, it would definitely have to be Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.
4 ...To find this book that captured the time and feel of my grandparents and my parents time of life.  I liked this book.  To me it is a "Toby Tyler" for adults.  An escape to the circus. It is well written and engaging.  I was expecting a sappy love story and this is simply a good story.
5 a friend lent this book to me and i really enjoyed it a lot. the writing is nice and clear and switches between current day where jacob is in a nursing home and back then in the 1930s when he works for a circus. most of the story happens at the circus and tells about what jacob did for an elephant who was being abused by the circus boss. it was a fantastic read, im really glad i read it! highly recommended.
5 This book glued me to the edge of my seat and held me there by my heartstrings. Very poignant account of a young man who came into his own not once but twice...a must-read!
5 I just finished listening to this audio book and I have to say it was truly wonderful.  I felt the circus come alive, great imagery and historic detail.  You could picture the circus`s shows with great detail.  I listened to this while commuting and found myself really enjoying my drive to and  from  work, traffic and all. The only negative was the sex.  My tween daughter really wanted to read this book because of the movie trailer but I had to say no right away after just the first chapter or so.  It really didn't add that much to the story and wasn't needed.
5 I loved this book, not only was it extremely entertaining...it was so informative. I learned so much. The circus never interested me, but since the book had such great reviews I decided to try it out.  I'm glad I did.  I highly recommend this book.  It is dark and creepy at some points, depressing, but there is just something about it... you will fall in love with Rosie.
4 The book kept me interested and moved along very well. The beginning was OK but the end was the best part. I have not seen the movie.
5 I absolutely loved this book. It was so well written and I was easily able to connect to the characters. I was gripping my seat the whole time I was reading this. It was phenomenal.
4 It's all in the details and the people who become real. I liked how the author used past and present to age Jacob.  It added depth to a story which was already full of twists and turns.
5 Well-written, colorful characters, fun read. The authorised a great job of painting a vivid picture and making me feel like I was right there with the circus crew.
5 This book is a MUST read.The other reviews are all true and helpful....... from the very first line this story carries you away.  The emotion invoked was strong.  There isn't any way to describe this book.  It moved me to anger, tears, horror, vindication.  In the end, I had a different outlook on entertainment involving animals and on the human being aging.
5 Water for Elephants was mesmerizing.  Form beginning to end, the characters were compelling and the research meticulous.  I couldn't put the book down.
5 As I neared the end of this book, I was so sad. It was just such a wonderful, rich, charming story that I wanted it to continue forever!I was completely enchanted by Gruen's story and way with words. From page 1 of the prologue, she had captured my full attention with vivid imagery and intriguing characters. When you read great historical fiction like this, it's hard not to get sucked into the world and time of the characters. Water for Elephants does this to perfection--my mind was transported back to Depression-era America, as I traveled on a train-circus, mingling with performers and working-men alike. It was a fun and fantastical adventure.Gruen's story, gritty at times and uplifting at others, is compelling to say the least--I never wanted to set this book down! I thought the author's technique of transporting the reader back and forth between Jacob's time with the Benzini Brothers and his later years spent at the nursing home was done magnificently. And it was the his nursing home days that really made Jacob such a well-developed and likeable main character.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story! You will not be disappointed.
5 Excellently written and completely absorbing.It's one of those rare books that has no part you will want to skim over or read through.The characters and the story linger in your mind long after you finish reading the book.The book itself is so good that it is easier to read than the best reviews here.
5 I didn't realize this book had been out for so long when I ordered it from Amazon.  Can't believe I hadn't heard of it before because it was a fantastic book I should have picked up sooner.  I think a movie is being made about the book, but I am glad I read the book first.  It's a quick read for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Definitely entertaining.  After I finished it, I felt like I was still transported back to the 1930's circus, and it took several hours to stop thinking about it.  Worth reading for sure.
5 Someone gave me my first copy of this.  It sat around my house for weeks before I finally picked it up...  and couldn't put it down.  Since then I have purchased copies for everyone I know.  Not a huge fan of the movie, but I have read this book several times which I rarely do unless the book is really special.  This one is a keeper.  BUY IT.  You'll want an elephant of your own  : )
4 Jacob Jankowski is ninety years old -- or maybe he's ninety-three; he doesn't remember.  However, he does remember a very interesting part of his life.  It comes about one day when the news that a circus is in town and one of Jacob's fellow nursing home inmates brags about having worked at a circus and giving water to the elephants.  Jacob knows the old man is full of it.  After all, Jacob once worked at a circus.  Rewind seventy-something years, to the 1930s, amid the Great Depression.  Jacob is twenty-three, just weeks away from getting his degree in Cornwall University to become a certified veterinarian.  Then he receives the news that his parents died in a terrible accident.  He also discovers that they had no money -- they had invested every last penny on Jacob's Ivy League education.  Distraught, Jacob runs away.  By accident, he ends up on a train, destination unknown.  He discovers that the train is actually one that carries a traveling circus.  One thing leads to another, and he ends up working as a sort of unofficial caretaker for the animals.  He meets August and his wife Marlena.  Jacob learns many secrets to life as a circus performer and worker, meets lots of interesting people, and encounters some very unsavory things.  August, for instance, is a very unstable, unpredictable person.  He is abusive to the animals and insufferable one moment, and completely charming and obliging the next.  The way he treats the animals, especially Rosie, the new performing elephant, makes Jacob sick, but he can't do anything about it.  The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth has its awful moments, but things get worse for Jacob when he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena...I like the way Water for Elephants changes from Jacob's present-day narrative as a cynical old man with early signs of dementia to his days as a nave young man and his struggles with wanting to fit into the Benzini Brothers and wanting to lose his virginity.  The way his voice and narrative change is clear and precise and you get drawn into this unique and at times quirky novel.  The backdrop of the Depression is wonderful and believable.  The secondary characters are compelling, especially Walter, August, Uncle Al and Marlena.  August is a horrible person, and the scenes centered on his abuse toward Rosie the elephant are indeed sickening.  It's a good thing Gruen spares us from too much information in terms of the actual abuse.  Rosie sounds adorable and I loved it when she was in the scenes.  I very much enjoyed Water for Elephants.  It's very moving and entertaining.  No wonder it became a #1 New York Times bestseller!  Even though the NYT list has never influenced my reading, especially since the stuff that makes the top list is mostly trash, it's nice to see that readers get it right every once in a while.  Sara Gruen is a great author.  I look forward to reading her future works.
5 A friend recommended this book to me and I very much enjoyed it I found this book to be very entertaining. At first I thought "I have no interest learning abot a circus" but this book had a great story line. It held my attention and I couldn't put it down. I found the story to be descrptive enough to play like a movie as I read it (and no, I've not even seen the movie). I'm looking forward to reading other books by this author
5 Changes how you look at things. Great read, it's a classic. I loved reading this book. It's still good in 2013.
4 This book had me hooked from the first chapter.  It's a great saga of the circus life. It was an easy read and had a story line that kept me entertained.
5 This was a book that was hard to put down and I have recommended it to all my reader friends.  I loved the way it jumped between when he was a young man and now an older man.  It also seems so realistic about how a person might feel when they are so elderly.  I really enjoyed it and I never will think of the circus the same way.
2 I don't know why this book is on the best seller lists.  While the story is interesting, the writing is too one-dimensional.  The character development is elementary at best.  In my view, this book seems to have been written by a child.  It is so simple; it lacks depth.  What's up with the reading public?
5 My book club chose this book in the spring.  I decided not to read it at that time, despite the wonderful reviews.  Last week I picked it up to read while we were lounging at the cabin.  Wow!  What took me so long?This is one of the finest stories I've read in a long time.  It grabbed me in the beginning and pulled me through to the end.  It had a bit of everything---humor, adventure, romance, heartbreak.Water for Elephants is the story of a young man who accidentally joins a circus train in 1931.  Along with him we meet some wonderful characters---both human and animal.Spoiler Alert---I enjoy a story with a happy, yet satisfying ending.  This book did not disappoint.
5 I could almost see Tom Hanks playing the lead character in the movie, even though I have not seen it.Would recommend this to anyone.
2 The difficulty of writing a book that is a "good read" is that it must sweep you up and make you forget the world around you. You must become so invested in the daily life and fate of the characters that you become more interested in what is happening on the page than what is going on in your life. At its sporadic best, this novel is a good read. The author has chosen an interesting world and time to write about and obviously done her homework. But homework is not enough. The great nagging problems however are she is neither a good nor original writer. Consequently the characters she has created are wooden and every third sentence out of their mouths is either predictable or a howling cliche. The characters themselves are comprised of one cliche after the other-- the good hearted innocent hero, the evil boss, the plucky sidekick (a dwarf, no less),the bewitching damsel in distress, the schizo villain who is mean to animals... You've seen them all too many times before in books, movies, even cartoons. So when they meet their fates you shrug because you guessed what would happen to each of them fifty pages(or more) before. The book's huge success is similar to the success of a McDonald's hamburger-- you know what you're going to get as you walk into the place.
5 just when I thought I knew what was coming, the story took another clever twist. this was definitely a page-turner of the highest magnitude.  don't miss it!
4 It was an interesting story, written well.  I have a new respect for elephants and the opposite for cruel handlers.
5 This is a great story about love and the passage of time.  I normally do not read fiction, but took a chance on this book, and I'm so glad I did. The straight forward story telling keeps you in the moment. I thought about this tale long after I had finished reading it.  I would recommend it to anyone.
5 I read this book about a year ago. I was a little unsure of the subject matter, however, the book pulled me in. I got very interested in the various characters, I found that it was one of my favorite books I read last year.
3 I feel a little weird writing a critical review about this book. It was strongly recommended to me by several people who said it was "a great story" so I was expecting something that would truly captivate me and pull me in. For me, it simply fell short.I think that a tremendous amount of time and effort went into the research involved for this book and that should not go unnoticed. If you're looking for a book that clearly depicts the Great Depression and/or circus life during that time period - by all means you should pick up the book. I do not know a tremendous amount about that time period to tell you if it was fully accurate, but I feel that it did give me a pretty good picture of what circus life would be like in that era. The photographs installed at the beginning of each chapter also did a great job connecting the story with the reality of traveling circuses of the time. The language probably could have corresponded a bit more, but in terms of the spirit and energy of the book versus the time period in which it takes place, I think it was pretty spot on.However, I really had trouble connecting with the characters. They simply did not seem like well-rounded, real people to me. I understand that the characters should be eccentric considering they are individuals traveling with a circus, but not to the point where they should seem artificial. Their emotional reactions to various tumultuous situations seemed unrealistic - based on having experienced similar situations in my life. The psychological repercussions would have been huge for a lot of the major conflicts that occur in the book - especially during the time of the Great Depression - but I did not feel the degree of inner struggle within the characters was well represented throughout the story. The characters would get sad or angry, but they seemed to sedate their feelings pretty darn quick.The depiction of the main character in his old age, however, seemed more realistic to me. I thought the scenes in the nursing home were very well done and true to life. The characters in these parts also seemed more believable to me. However, I was pretty disappointed in the ending. It seemed contrived. I will not get into it too deeply, however, so as not to spoil the story.I genuinely feel that Sara Gruen is a great author and did a good job with the book, I just feel that the character development was lacking. In terms of painting a picture of the environment though, she did a fantastic job and it's a book worth reading, if only for the descriptive element of it. Plus, tons of people simply LOVE the book - it just wasn't for me in the end.
5 This was a well written book.  Intriguing and kept me going until the book was all read.  I was hoping there would be a sequel but none so far.
4 At first glance, one might be inclined to think this circus novel an appropriate read for an adolescent audience.  However, parents may wish to read it first, as the novel contains overt sexuality and animal cruelty.That being said, both of the storylines are gripping.  The younger character experiences life in the circus as both cruel and rewarding.  The older character finds aging to be the same.
4 Sara Gruen's engaging novel "Water for Elephants" is a well researched and cleverly formatted reminiscence of one Jacob Jankowski, a 93 or 90 year old (he can't remember which) assisted living inhabitant.  Jankowski, still in possesion of his faculties, had worked in circuses for many years and this novel is a flashback to his life at that time.  Gruen spins her story alternating chapters of Jankowski's past and present.Jankowski had been an enthusiastic veterinary student at prestigious Cornell university.  Days before sitting for his final exams, he shockingly learns that his parents had been killed in an tragic auto accident.  To his dismay, he stunningly learns that due to the economic downturn of the Great Depression, his father's veterinary business and whole estate is essentially worthless.  His parents mortgaged everything to pay for his education.Distraught and penniless, Jankowski aimlessly wanders from the Cornell campus, eventually hitching a ride, hobo style on a train that was home to the Benzini Brothers circus.  Mentored by a alcoholic but kindly circus worker named Camel, he starts working caring for the animals in what was known as the menagerie.  He will assume the duties of a true vet and work under the schizophrenic equestrian director August.  Augie is married to celebrated equestrian performer Marlena, who Jankowski falls deeply in love with."Water for Elephants" is essentially a look back into the 3 1/2 months that Jankowski worked in the circus revealing the seamier underbelly of circus life from the side unseen by the "rubes"  or circus-goers.  The book concludes with the nonagenarian Jankowski once again fulfilling an improbable circus fantasy.
5 This book is very touching and entertaining. I was reluctant to read this but once I started, I just can't put it down. If you like to know about what it is like behind the circus' life, being old and left alone..pick this one. You will understand more how to deal with old people and what its in their mind... I have no doubt I will re read this book again in the future
4 I will say I have not seen the movie, I just read the book. This was a good book. I read it in 2 days because I got very involved in the plot. There were a couple of things I did not like, for example what happened to two of his buddies, but the story itself was good. You will never look at the circu the same way afte reading this one.
4 Good book, pleasant read with some sad parts.  I would read it again.  The life of a cut circus performer\worker is pretty entertaining.
4 This book took me by surprise.  It seemed to drag a bit through the first few chapters, but then it got very interesting very quickly.  I was not a fan of the bad language, but the author really tries to put the reader in the rough circus setting and unfortunately, the circus is composed of less-than-polished people.  This book is full of action, and has a great romance story.  I loved the ending.  Minus the language and crudeness, I would give this book 5 out of 5.PS (I'VE HEARD THAT ROBERT PATTINSON WILL BE PLAYING JACOB JANKOWSKI IN THE MOVIE IN 2011!)
5 I just finished "Water for Elephants" the day before yesterday!  I can't seem to find anything I want to read now as that story just won't go away.  It was far and beyond one of my favorite books.  I just loved it!  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  Now I want to see more pictures of the old circuses.  Amazing what she was able to capture with her words and that she could understand what an old man could be feeling and thinking.  I love it when I can find a book like hers.  I highly recommend it!
5 This by far was one of the best books that I have read this year!  Ms. Gruen takes us there, to the Circus in the depression era, the whole experience was riviting from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this to anyone contemplating choosing this book, you will not be disappointed!  I look forward to reading her other published works, although it will be tough to top this one!
4 This book was an absolute delight to read.  Characters fleshed out enough to actually care about them and a well-researched insight into Depression-era circus life.As fare as plot goes, there's probably nothing you haven't already seen or read a hundred times over in romance novels, or Lifetime Network movies for TV.  Same material set against a new backdrop.Sometimes a good read is just that - a good read.  It doesn't have to be life-changing - just entertaining.  I love how it was all told as a personal history.I do appreciate the author's exhaustive research to get the circus terms right.  My only (small) complaint (and maybe I missed something) was that not all the terms were defined for the reader.  It does not take away from the storyline at all.
2 I hesitate to slap a derisive label like "chick lit" on anything, but author Sara Gruen's third novel is a prime example of the worst kind of "women's fiction"; Water for Elephants was obviously written by a woman solely for other women, with no attempt to be realistic from the male point of view. Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him "unshaven" with the implication that what he really means is "unclean," you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and "chick flicks" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a "twist" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, "Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it! Now downstake it!" [p. 34].(Yeah, that's what she said!)
5 Very interesting characters in this novel.  I honestly enjoyed the main character when he was old and young.  Highly recommended!
4 don't know what I expected this to be about, but I was surprised, pleasantly.  Good characters, good story, good presentation.
5 At first I was skeptical about reading a book about a circus, but everyone I know that has read the book had given it great reviews.  I'm glad to say I was not disappointed.  The author did a great job with this book and detailing the era in which it is written.  I bought this book on my Kindle and can honestly say I could not put it down - the convenience of having my Kindle books available through apps on my cell phone / computer and the actual Kindle made it even harder to put down and all the more exciting to read.  I highly recommend this book, it did not disappoint in any way!
5 I loved this book and the story is terrific.  I also thought the movie was done well.  Although I enjoy reading books more to get more of the details of the story which I think you miss in the movie.
5 I wish I had written my review for this novel a lot sooner, as I finished it over three months ago, especially since I loved it so much.  I am unable to comment on all the details that made this book highly enjoyable, but nonetheless I wanted to add my review.One of the first things that piqued my interest was the fact that the main character was 93-years old (or was it 90?) which lent a different perspective to the storyline and resolution.  Jaocb, was a very likeable main character in his old age and in his youth, but was not the only character you felt invested in. The character of Walter (Kinko) with this dog Queenie was just as intriguing despite his secondary role in the story.  As well, the antagonist, August, was just as aptly developed, which made you fear his anger towards Marlena and Rosie.  Speaking of Rosie, as an animal-lover, I cared deeply for her safety and sucess in the future of the circus.I was surprised to find out that the author knew very little about the circus prior to writing this book, but she did an excellent job of researching to pull off a very believable background/setting for this story.The characters live with you long after the story is over and you find yourself wondering what happened to Mr. Jacob Jankowski as he started on a new adventure in his life at 93 (or was it 90?).
5 Gripping and suspenseful. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I love romantic stories that have struggles and this definitely fulfilled that want.
4 Amazing. The author really did her research for this book. When reading it, it was hard to put down. She went back and forth between present day and memories, which usually bothers me, but here it didn't. I found that I enjoyed both time periods. Everything was well told and really brought the images to life while reading. It was a very colorful read.
5 "Is where you're from the place you're leaving or where you have roots?"Jacob Jankowski is a young man, studying to be a vet at Cornell. When both of his parents die in a car accident, Jacob is so torn up, he runs away in the middle of his final exams and joins up on a circus train, the Benzini Brothers' Most Spectacular Show on Earth. His life in the Depression era on a traveling circus are intercut with the present day, 90-something year old Jacob reminiscing about the past and dealing with one of the most difficult obstacles: life.I Liked:With the movie due to appear in theaters soon and the recommendation from a friend, I decided to hunt down an audiobook and listen. And, in short, am I glad.Before I started reading, I thought (based on either the blurb on the back cover and the movie trailer) that the book was a love story dressed up in circus costumes in the vein of James Cameron's "Titanic". Poor boy meets wealthy attached (married) girl, both fall in love, blah, blah, blah. Throw in some random animals, circus acts, and there you go.I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn't the case. The characters were beautifully drawn and real, from our protagonist and narrator, Jacob, to his bunkmate, Kinko/Walter, to our love interest, Marlena, to our antagonist, Big Al. The story focuses more on the circus life than on the love between Marlena and Jacob. The setting was beautiful and intricate, the ambience was spectacular and grotesque (sometimes at the same time!), and I truly felt transported back into the past. Not to mention, there were many tearjerker moments--real, emotional moments, not those written just to elicit a pornographic emotional response.Jacob was a good narrator. I felt his pain as his parents died, I understood his awe at Rosie, I felt his disgust at August's disgusting behavior. But my favorite character was Marlena, and I can definitely see why Reese Witherspoon was cast as her. She is spunky, fun, mature, and spirited. My heart broke hearing how her family abandoned her just because she married a Jew (she was Catholic), and I hated how August treated her. Walter was also another great character. It was terrible how his mother basically sold him to the circus just because of his dwarfism. And the scene where he almost loses Queenie really brought home how alone and lonely this poor guy was.So many novels these days seem to be window dressing for a love story, but this novel isn't one of them. Sure, a cornerstone of the novel is about Marlena and Jacob, but there is much more going on. A man's journey into coping with death. The horrors of the circus. How hard life was back in the Depression. Escapism. The trials of growing older. The need to belong. The story deftly wove back and forth between younger and older Jacob, and I found myself interested in BOTH sides, not just one or the other.I Didn't Like:In places, the novel is very graphic. I didn't care for when Jacob barged in on someone AHEMing or hearing about the two ladies AHEMing Jacob.I would have liked to have seen a little more of the acts that went on in the circus, though I suppose those would work better in a visual medium.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:A few f-bombs, amongst milder profanities.Jacob is interested in losing his virginity. While drunk, two women try to perform sexual acts on him, but Jacob vomits on one. Two characters make love; "self love" is shown once or twice.The story opens with a character about to be impaled. Camel is crippled because of his drinking. August is abusive to his animals and to others. Workers have been thrown off the train, a practice called "red lighting".Overall:This is an impressive book, one that totally bucked all my prejudices and preconceived notions. It was able to do what a lot of books can't: make me care about the characters and take me to another "world". I only hope that the movie, when it comes out, can do it justice. Highly recommended.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*
5 I read both of Sara Gruen's previous books - primarily because they were horse stories.  I was really looking forward to her next book and was disappointed to see that it wasn't about horses at all.  It hit the best seller list and I read the reviews.  It didn't appeal to me at all.  I read more reviews.  Eh. Finally, I decided to read it.  I'm so glad I did!  This is one of those books that draws you in on the first page and doesn't let you go until the end.  I'm recommending this to everyone I know -and I'm recommending it to you.  Read it - you won't be sorry.
4 I found this book so easy to read! It was entertaining, educational and just troubling enough to keep me totally captivated. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good book with characters you can enjoy and despise.
5 I really enjoyed this book - read it in 2 nights and in the end came away with a good feeling.  The insight into the old circus life was interesting & exciting.  The insight into how our elderly are treated was sad and eye opening.  Then in-between was woven love, adventure, friendship, animals, racism, murder, mystery, with a happy ending.  What more could you ask for?
5 I bought this book based on the reviews, and I loved it. It may not be perfect, but it is a great, fun, easy read. Loved the ending!
5 Water for Elephants gives you a peek at the life of circus performers and the crew during a time when jobs were scarce in America. The characters in the story are as colorful on stage as off. This is a book that you won't want to put down as the circus train weaves in and out of towns with the array of likable and seedy characters.  And just when you think you know how the story will end--you will discover you were wrong.
5 If you read no other novel this year, make it this one.  This is perhaps the most extraordinary novel I've read in literally years, from an author with truly AWESOME talent.  Generally, I read almost nothing but mystery novels...and ones with "hard-bitten" heroes, at that...not even a hint of anything sniveling.  I'm just not a touchie-feelie kind of girl.  So if a feel-good book like this can affect me so enormously, just think what it'll do for those of you who like this kind of stuff!  Only partly joking here; but truly, this is one magnificent work of literary art.  Inside glimpses of life in a 1930's circus are so intimately written and ring so true, that it's hard to believe Ms. Gruen isn't 90 years old, writing memoirs.  Each character is so artfully rendered that you care, and care deeply!, about every single one of them.  You love them or hate them, with equal measures of intensity.  Add the super special treat at the beginning of most chapters of real photos from these old circuses, and you have just a jewel of a book.  Obviously, I'm drooling all over myself in this review, but I can't recommend it strongly enough, to everyone, no matter your preferences in reading material.  I took a chance and am SO glad I did.  Oh, and Ms. Gruen has a sense of humor too!  There are parts of the book where I guarantee you will be unable to hold back from a big belly laugh, right out loud.  Please, get this book.  You will NOT regret a single minute of reading time.  I fully intend to go now and buy every book she's every written, hoping for another glimpse of her genius.
3 I decided to read this book because I was looking for something different and I did find that.  I thought it was well written and it was a very quick read but I have to say that for me it was not a four or five star read.  The characters were interesting, and Rosie was great!!  A fun read but not all it was built up to be for me.
5 An intriguingly wonderful history lesson that allows us a look at the history makers' heart! We all have feelings; we all need to express them. Thank you Mrs. Gruen.
5 My two best friends and I are all avid readers, although we usually read very different books. One of them got it, loved it and gave it to me, and this book was passed around for several months. We had a mother in law, an ex boyfriend all reading it, which really speaks to how good the book is.You can read the other reviews to find out what its about...I'm telling you, you will be hooked instantly. Clear your schedule. This isn't a book you want to start reading when its going to be a week before you can pick it up again.
5 This book is a must-read. I couldn't put it down in for the whole two days it took to read. In a way I've already imagined what it would be like as a movie- because the author uses such rich imagedry you feel like you're at the circus with Jacob and Marlena. It's really a facinating book- GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!!
5 Stop reading reviews and buy the book! Seriously! The author took time to research old school circus art and politics. I truly enjoyed this book
5 Water for Elephants is an awesome story about an engaging character that had me sneaking my kindle out at work to read a bit more.I loved it from start to finish. Some have criticized the amalgamation of the Jacob story from the Bible and post depression circuses but it works beautifully.The level of detail and insight into the train circus world shows an incredible amount of research but one of the most amazing things is none of those details come across as research. They are as natural to the story as the characters.
5 Not being, even remotely, a Robert Pattinson fan and not liking circuses either, I put off reading this book for several months after it was purchased.  I still couldn't help visualizing Robert Pattinson as the lead character, but eventually, the story took over and Robert faded a little.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really liked the book.  Well written, good story line and a bit of a surprise ending.  Still won't watch the movie (that Robert thing again) but the book is always better anyway.
3 Yes, this story reads like a script and I was interested in the characters.....however I thought the terrible things that happen was just too much.  Reading about the terrible things that happen to animals, the perverted things that carnies do, it was just too much - I wanted to erase that stuff from my brain the moment I read it.  That is just not entertaining to me at all.  I really did enjoy how the book tied "what happened" from the beginning to the end, very nicely.  That was very interesting to me and I'm glad I finished it.  I could do without all the other crap though.
5 I loved this book, even though I have sold a lot of my books because of a lack of shelf space, this one I will always keep. Have already recommended it to many of my friends. Don't want to say anything about the story, it is a treasure.
